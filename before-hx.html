    <p>In obstetric and gynecological practice, intimate details must be elicited; this requires tact, discretion, and maintenance of proper confidentiality.</p>
    <p>The usual preparation for history taking should be followed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A courteous greeting and introduction.</li>
        <li>A statement as to your status. Be open about your status as a medical student or junior doctor.</li>
        <li>A careful check that you have the correct patient, that she understands the language and seemingly has competence (that she is of appropriate age).</li>
        <li>In all consultations, you should describe the process that is about to take place and get an agreement or verbal consent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>History must be taken in a non-judgemental, sensitive and thorough manner.</p>
    <p>Maintain good communication with the patient in order to elicit proper history and be accurately able to recognize her problems.</p>
    <p>Kindness and courtesy must be maintained at all times. A gentle manner and a genuine interest in the patient help the development of a good professional relationship.</p>
    <p>It is important for a male doctor to perform examination in the presence of a female chaperone.</p>
    <p>Clinicians must adopt both an empathetic and inquisitive attitude towards the patient.</p>
    <p  class="underlined--offset">The patient‚Äôs privacy must be respected at all costs.</p>
    <p>You must refrain from asking personal questions until appropriate patient confidence has been established.</p>
    <p>Listen more and talk less while taking history.</p>
    <p>Avoid interrupting, commanding and lecturing while taking history.</p>
    <p>If any serious condition is suspected, the diagnosis must not be disclosed to the patient until it has been confirmed by performing investigations.</p>
    <p>Have several differential diagnoses in mind after each clerking.</p>
    <p>Rule out diseases and choose a diagnosis based on the information in the history you took.</p>
    <p>Know how you are going to manage the patient for your diagnosis. Management should include things like investigations and treatments.</p>
    <p>There are different systems for eliciting a history. We try to make the ones outlined here as comprehensive and relevant as possible by continually updating them as needed and as often as possible.</p>
    <p>Not every part of the history taking format outlined is going to be relevant for all patient, hence, it should be adapted to individual patient.</p>
