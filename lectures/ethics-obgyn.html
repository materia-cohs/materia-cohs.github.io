            <p>Gynecology:  Deals with physiology and pathology of the female reproductive organs in the non-pregnant state.</p>

            <p>Controversial. Has several aspects to it; politics, social, religious, medical.</p>
            <p>It remains illegal and criminal</p>
            <p>It may however be performed if there is </p>

                <li>Genetic counseling, screening and prenatal diagnosis are readily available, and</li>
                <li>Pregnant mothers has the right to expect obstetrician to fully inform her of any reason the obstetrician has to believe that her fetus might be handicapped.</li>

            <p>Genetic counselling should be morally nondirective i.e. obstetrician should be impartial and objective and it should provide information that will allow competent counselees to make informed decision.</p>

            <p>Pre-test counselling is needed.</p>
            <p>Tests may yield information that may ultimately force some unwelcome choices i.e. abortion, adoption.</p>
            <p>What is at stake is the right to decide whether or not to have a genetic test.</p>
            <p>Right to refuse if potential harm (stigma, unacceptable choices) out weights potential benefits.</p>

           <p>Feto-maternal relationship is a unique one.  It requires Obstetrician to promote a balance of maternal health and fetal welfare ‚Äì while respecting maternal autonomy.</p>
           <p>The decision of competent pregnant woman must be honored in all but ‚Äúextremely rare and fully exceptional‚Äù cases.</p>
           <p>Although reasonable steps to persuade a woman to change her mind are appropriate.</p>
           <p>Ethics is about the use and abuse of power.  The ability of person‚Äôs states and systems to change lives and events for good or ill.</p>
           <p>Sometimes the effect of such power is discreet, almost imperceptible.  At other times it is so overwhelming that it tips into coercion or even violence, verbal, moral or physical.</p>
           <p>Professionals have a special responsibility to be sensitive to the way in which the power conferred on them by their professional standing is used. </p>
           <p>Professional codes of ethics are largely designed to protect clients and to ensure that inherent inequality in the client-caregiver relationship is not abused.</p>
           <p>In general, obstetrician must respect a woman‚Äôs informed right of choice and promote the woman‚Äôs acceptance of responsibility for the outcome of her choice (forced Caesarean Section).</p>
           <p>Obstetrician‚Äôs work with women, supporting their right to participate actively in decisions about their care, and empowering women to speak for themselves on issues affecting the health of women and their families in their culture/society.</p>
