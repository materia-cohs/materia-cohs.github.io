                <p>Maternal Mortality is a death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of a termination of a pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental and incidental causes [WHO, 1977].</p>
                
                <p><span class="special-text">Implications of Definition: </span></p>
                <p>Duration and site of pregnancy does not matter. </p>
                <p>Deaths in early pregnancy from abortions and ectopics are maternal deaths.</p>
                <p>Classification of maternal deaths into direct and indirect causes and exclusion of accidental and incidental causes.</p>

                <p><span class="special-text">A Maternal Near-Miss Case:</span></p>
                <p>Defined as ‚Äúa woman who nearly died but survived a complication that occurred during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy‚Äù.</p>

                <p><span class="special-text">Maternal Mortality Ratio:</span></p>
                <p>Maternal deaths/livebirths x 100,000.</p>

                <p>It is expressed as number of deaths per 100,000 live births [or as per 1000 where it is low]</p>
                <p>Range for Nigeria is 3 - 12 per 1000.</p>
                <p>Average [814 per 100,000]</p>

            <div class='body'>
                    <p>At least half a million women die each year of pregnancy-related causes. Ninety-nine percent live in developing countries. Two approaches can reduce these deaths. First, make pregnancy and delivery safer once women become pregnant; second, reduce the number of pregnancies through family planning. Family planning reduces maternal mortality in several ways.</p>
                    <p>At the individual level, family planning reduces the number of times a woman becomes pregnant. Generally speaking, women of higher parity face greater risks in pregnancy. For example, a woman who has been pregnant six times has twice the risk of dying a maternal death as a woman who has been pregnant only three times. </p>
                    <p>Family planning reduces the number of unintended and unwanted pregnancies. Unwanted pregnancies are far more likely to end in induced abortion, and are far less likely to receive adequate prenatal care than wanted pregnancies. In some situations, abortions account for up to half of all pregnancy-related deaths. The potential for family planning to reduce these deaths is very great. </p>
                    <p>At the national level, family planning reduces the number of pregnancies and births. Even without any improvement in obstetric care, a 10% reduction in the number of pregnancies will produce a 10% (or greater) reduction in the number of maternal deaths. </p>
                    <p>Family planning can be targeted to reduce the number of pregnancies to women in groups at increased risk of maternal death, that is women who are too young (< 20), too old (>35 or >39), or women who are high parity (more than 5 previous births). </p>
                    <p>By far the most important way of reducing maternal deaths is simply by reducing the number of pregnancies. By itself, this is very effective. But it is important to pay simultaneous attention to improving obstetric care. Most women want to have at least two children, and they should have good quality care during pregnancy and for delivery. Ideally, these two interventions -- family planning and obstetric care -- should go hand-in-hand. </p>
                    <p>An important point to notice in the table is that, at least in the study area, it is far more effective (in terms of preventing maternal mortality) to prevent births to young (< 20) women than to prevent births to older women. Only 2.5% of the deaths and 2.1% of the births in Matlab occurred to women older than 39, but 32% of the deaths and 21% of the births occurred to women younger than 20; younger women are clearly at increased risk of dying in childbirth and during pregnancy. </p>
                    <p>The greatest impact of family planning on maternal mortality is for those women who are less 20 years of age. While it is a sensitive issue in many cultures, delaying pregnancy by increasing family planning use among both married and unmarried women < 20 could save many lives.</p>
                    <p>In countries where fertility is already low, the impact on maternal mortality of expanding access to family planning will not be great. There is one important exception to this; where fertility is low because of widespread use of abortion, family planning can save lives by preventing abortions.</p>

              <p>Essential obstetric care is the term used to describe the elements of obstetric care needed for the management of normal and complicated pregnancy, delivery and the postpartum period. </p>
              <p>Essential Obstetric Care is defined for two different levels of the health care system: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Basic essential obstetric care</li>
                  <li>Comprehensive essential obstetric care</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Basic essential obstetric care services at the health center level should include at least the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Parenteral antibiotics </li>
                  <li>Parenteral oxytocic drugs </li>
                  <li>Parenteral sedatives/anti-convulsants for eclampsia </li>
                  <li>Partograph monitoring</li>
                  <li>Manual removal of placenta </li>
                  <li>Manual removal of retained products </li>

                </ul>

                <p>Comprehensive essential obstetric care services at the district hospital level (first referral level) should include all the above plus:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Surgery </li>
                  <li>Anesthesia, and </li>

                  <li>AVD ‚Äì Forceps or Vacuum </li>

                </ul>

                <p>These essential obstetric functions are vital to manage the five most important causes of maternal deaths: sepsis, haemorrhage, eclampsia, obstructed labour and abortion.</p>
