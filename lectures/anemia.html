                <p>Oral ferrous and folic acid should be given daily to all pregnant women.</p>
                <p>Malaria prophylaxis should be given.</p>
                <p>Health education on child spacing and contraception, balanced diet, etc.</p>
                <p>An average Western diet supplies around 250 μg/day of folate; however, requirements increase to around 400 μg/day during pregnancy, with deficiency most commonly due to lack of folate-rich vegetables.</p>
                <p>Folate deficiency is more common in-</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Multiple pregnancy</li>
                    <li>Frequent childbirth, and </li>
                    <li>Adolescent mothers.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>The body stores around <span class="special-text-3">3 mg</span> of B<sub>12</sub>, with a daily dietary requirement of <span class="special-text-3">3μg /day</span>. The only B<sub>12</sub> source is animal foodstuffs; thus, vegetarians and vegans are most at risk of dietary deficiency.</p>
                <p>Iron requirements increase due to expansion of red blood cell mass and rapid growth of the fetus. This need outstrips the <span class="special-text-3">1 mg/d</span> of iron available from the normal diet and must be met by supplementation of at least <span class="special-text-3">40 mg/d</span> of elemental iron (10% of which is absorbed). There is increased absorption in deficiency states.</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>And <span class="special-text-3">400 µg (0.4 mg)</span> folic acid is recommended.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The equivalent of <span class="special-text-3">65 mg</span> of elemental iron is <span class="special-text-3">200 mg</span> <span class="underlined--offset">ferrous sulphate</span>, <span class="special-text-3">180 mg</span> <span class="underlined--offset">ferrous fumarate</span> or <span class="special-text-3">500 mg</span> of <span class="underlined--offset">ferrous gluconate</span>.</p>
                <p>Folic acid should be commenced as early as possible (ideally before conception) to prevent neural tube defects.</p>
                <p>In established cases: Ferrous sulphate 200mg (65mg of elemental iron) is given 3 times a day. If it is not well tolerated (there may be constipation, abdominal upset etc.)Ferrous fumarate or gluconate should be given.</p>
                <p>Iron absorption is maximized when combined with ascorbic acid such as with fresh orange juice or a vitamin C preparation.</p>
                <p>Parenteral therapy is useful in malabsorption and failed compliance, but otherwise does not produce a faster response than oral iron and side effects are common.</p>
                <p><span class="underlined--offset">Proven folate deficiency anemia should be treated with folic acid (<span class="special-text-3">5 mg/day</span>)</span>.</p>
                <p>In all such cases of anemia, B<sub>12</sub> deficiency must also be excluded, as folate may improve the anemia of B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, but exacerbate any associated neurological deterioration.</p>
                <p>In B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, a single dose of <span class="special-text-3">1000 μg</span> of intramuscular B<sub>12</sub> should lead to a reticulocyte response within <span class="special-text-3">3–7 days</span>.</p>
                <p>Weekly injections should be employed until anemia resolves.</p>
                <p>Severe anemia and moderate anemia close to/at term/ in labor requires transfusion with screened packed cells.</p>

                <p>Disorder of production of hemoglobin.</p>
                <p><span class="special-text">α-thalassemias</span> are caused by an α-globin chain synthesis defect.  They result from partial (α<sup>+</sup>) or total (α<sup>0</sup>) deletions. Total deletion or deficiency not compatible with life.</p>
                <p><span class="special-text">β-thalassemia</span> syndromes  are the result of insufficient (β<sup>+</sup>) or absent (β<sup>0</sup>) production of β-globin chains.</p>
                <p>These are autosomal recessive condition.</p>

            <div class='body'>
                <p>Include the <span class="special-text">Hb S</span>, <span class="special-text">Hb C</span> and <span class="special-text">Hb E</span>.</p>
                <p> In the HbS hemoglobin the β globin chain has an amino acid substitution of VALINE for GLUTAMIC ACID at CODON 6</p>
                <p>While for Hb C, the β globin chain has substitution of LYSINE for GLUTAMIC ACID at CODON 6.</p>
                <p>Hemoglobin E (HbE) is an abnormal hemoglobin with a single point mutation in the β chain. At POSITION 26 there is a change in the amino acid, from GLUTAMIC ACID to LYSINE. (Native to south East Asia).</p>
                <p>Inherited as autosomal recessive disorders.</p>
                <p>Homozygous – Hb SS, Hb CC, Hb EE.</p>
                <p>Heterozygous –Hb SC, AS, SE.</p>
                <p>The term “sickle-cell disease” includes all manifestations of abnormal HbS presentation. These include homozygous sickle-cell disease (HbSS) and a range of mixed heterozygous hemoglobinopathies (HbS/β-thalassemia, HbSC disease, and other combinations).</p>
                <p>Sickle cell disease is prevalent in Tropical Africa, black Americans, offsprings of mixed marriages (black & white), Caribbean, Middle East and Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>Incidence is about <span class="special-text-3">5%</span> of African stock for the trait and <span class="special-text-3">1-2%</span> are homozygous.</p>
                <p>These are autosomal inherited diseases.</p>
                <p>Decreased oxygen tension causes hemoglobin S to form insoluble polymer in curvilinear strands and these deform the normal biconcave shape of the erythrocytes (sickling).</p>

                </figure>
                <p>The sickle shape also results in altered motion through the microvasculature which can predispose the patient to vascular stasis, hypoxia, acidosis, and increased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, which perpetuates the cycle by resulting in further deoxygenation and, thus, more sickling. The microvascular injury can result in ischemic necrosis and end-organ infarction.</p>
                <p>These permanently damaged RBCs are then removed by the reticuloendothelial system, with the average RBC lifespan reduced to <span class="special-text-3">17 days</span>. The result is a chronic compensated anemia, with Hb typically measured between <span class="special-text-3">6.5</span> and <span class="special-text-3">9.5 g/dL</span>.</p>
                <p>Organs affected by chronic sickling include the spleen, lungs, kidneys, heart, and brain. </p>
                <p>Patients with sickle cell anemia are functionally asplenic. </p>
                <p>The spleen is crucial to the host response to infection by clearing polysaccharide-encapsulated bacteria. Encapsulated pathogens are opsonized with antibodies and then phagocytized by specialized macrophages in the spleen.</p>
                <p>Therefore, immunization for and aggressive treatment against <span class="underlined--offset">encapsulated organisms (pneumococcus and meningococcus) is recommended when such are diagnosed</span>.</p>
                <p>Hb SC is peculiarly associated with embolization of necrotic fat and cellular bone marrow with resultant respiratory insufficiency; aseptic necrosis of femoralhead and acute chest syndrome can result from the release of fat emboli after marrow infarction.</p>
