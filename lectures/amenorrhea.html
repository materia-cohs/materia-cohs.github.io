            <p>In the presence of secondary sexual characteristics, menstruation ought to occur within 2 years of the establishment of this development. </p>
            <p>Hence, primary amenorrhea is defined as a failure of spontaneous menstruation by the age of 16 years in the presence of normal secondary sexual characeristics, or 14 years in the absence of secondary sexual characteristics.</p>
            <p>There are five changes that occur, known as the secondary sexual characteristics. </p>

                    <p>May present at two ages of development. Early childhood when the infant presents with a bulging hymen and mucocele. It may also present in later life when a pubertal girl complains of intermittent abdominal pain, which is usually cyclical. </p>
                    <p>The pain is due to dysmenorrhea associated with the accumulation of menstrual blood within the vagina known as hematocolpos. It is also known as cryptomenorrhea.</p>
                    <p>When some blood accumulates within the uterine cavity, it is called hematometra. As the mass enlarges there may be associated difficulty with micturition and defecation. </p>
                    <p>Examination will reveal an abdominal swelling and a tense bulging bluish membrane which is the hymen.</p>
                    <p>It results from an error in urogenital sinus canalization</p>
                    <p>Treatment is hymenectomy/cruciate incision. </p>

                    <h4><span class="special-text-4">Transverse Vaginal Septum </span></h4>
                    <p>These girls present with cyclical abdominal pain due to the development of a hematocolpos </p>
                    <p>Clinical appearance is very different from that of an imperforate hymen. </p>
                    <p>An abdominal mass may be palpable but inspection of the vagina shows that it is blind ending. </p>
                    <p>The bulging is pink not blue. </p>
                    <p>Rectal exam may reveal a mass. </p>
                    <p>The hymenal remnants are often seen separately. Transverse vaginal septum may occur at three levels, known as a lower, middle or upper third septum. </p>
                    <p>This results from failure of fusion of the Mullerian duct and urogenital sinus derived portion of the vagina.</p>
                    <p>Treatment is with a cruciate incision. </p>

                    <h4><span class="special-text-4">Absent vagina and the functioning uterus </span></h4>
                    <p>This is a rare phenomenon when embryologically the uterine body has developed normally, but there is failure of development of the cervix. </p>
                    <p>This leads to failure of the development of the upper vagina. </p>
                    <p>The presenting symptom is again cyclical abdominal pain but there is no pelvic mass because there is no vagina. </p>
                    <p>Although a small haematometra may be present, retrograde menstruation occurs leading to the development of endometriosis and in some patients, pelvic adhesions. </p>
                    <p>This is known as the Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster- Hauser syndrome (or the MRKH syndrome). It is also known as Mullerian dysgenesis or utero-vaginal agenesis. In this condition, there is failure of development of the Mullerian ducts. It is usually associated with other skeletal and urogenital malformations but it can also be isolated.</p>
                    <p>This is the second most common cause of primary amenorrhea second only to Turner syndrome. </p>
                    <p>The individuals are genetically female with 46XX karyotype.</p>
                    <p>Secondary sexual characteristics are normal as would be expected as ovarian function is unaffected. </p>
                    <p>Examination of the genital area discloses normal female external genitalia but with a blind ending vaginal dimple which is usually not more than 1.5 cm in depth. </p>
                    <p>The uterine development is usually very rudimentary, often small uterine remnants (anlage) are found on the lateral pelvic side walls. </p>
                    <p>40% of these patients have renal anomalies and recognizable skeletal abnormalities. </p>

                    <h4><span class="special-text-4">XY Female </span></h4>
                    <p>Individual may have an XY karyotype and a female phenotype. This may be due to </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Failure of testicular development</li>
                        <li>Enzymatic failure of the testis to produce androgen particularly testosterone</li>
                        <li>Androgenic receptor absence or failure of function</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4><span class="special-text-4">Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome</span></h4>
                    <p>There is a structural abnormality with the androgen receptor, due to abnormalities of the androgen receptor gene, which results in a non-functional receptor. </p>
                    <p>The masculinizing effect of testosterone during normal development is absent.</p>
                    <p>It can be partial or complete depending on the amount of residual androgen receptors. In complete AIS, the individual develop female external genitalia with normal labia, clitoris and vaginal introitus, but the vagina ends blindly and they lack uterus and fallopian tubes.</p>
                    <p>All the Mullerian-derived structures are absent because the developed gonads are morphologically testes and the Sertolli cells produce anti-Mullerian hormones which inhibit Mullerian development</p>
                    <p>Patients are phenotypically female with normal breast development. At puberty, the increasing levels of androgens are converted to estrogens with normal female breast development and distribution of body fat.</p>
                    <p>Pubic hair is very scanty in these patients as there is no androgen response in target tissues. </p>
                    <p>The vulva is normal and the vagina is usually short. </p>
                    <p>The uterus and tubes are absent in this particular version of the XY female. </p>
                    <p>The testes are usually found in the lower abdomen, but occasionally may be found in hernial sacs in childhood. </p>

                    <h4><span class="special-text-4">Gonadal agenesis </span></h4>
                    <p><span class="special-text">46XX:</span> </p>
                    <p>The 46XX pure gonadal dysgenesis is an autosomal recessive disorder and other genes other than those located on the X chromosome are involved. </p>
                    <p><span class="special-text">46XY OR 45X/46XY:</span> </p>
                    <p>In 46XY or 45X/46XY, absence of testicular determining factor or its receptor are postulated as the cause of the failure of differentiation of the gonad</p>
                    <p>There is absence of testicular development. </p>

                    <h4><span class="special-text-4">Turner's syndrome </span></h4>
                    <p>In Turner's syndrome ovarian development is normal until 20 weeks' of gestation and at this stage oocytes are found in the ovaries. </p>
                    <p>Further maturation is impaired and a massive atresia occurs during the latter part of pregnancy. </p>
                    <p>The ovaries in most individuals consist solely of stroma and are unable to produce estrogen. </p>
                    <p>There is a normal female phenotype and internal genital development is also normal. </p>
                    <p>The loss of an X chromosome results in short stature. </p>

                    <h4><span class="special-text-4">Resistant ovary syndrome </span></h4>
                    <p>There are elevated levels of gonadotropins in the presence of apparently normal ovarian tissue. </p>
                    <p>Patients do have some degree of secondary sexual characteristic development but never produce adequate amounts of estrogen to result in menstruation. </p>

                    <h4><span class="special-text-4">Constitutional delay </span></h4>
                    <p>Normal secondary sexual characteristics exist. There is no anatomical anomaly and endocrine investigations are all normal. </p>

                    <h4><span class="special-text-4">Kallman syndrome </span></h4>
                    <p>The olfactogenital syndrome. </p>
                    <p>There is isolated GnRH deficiency. </p>
                    <p>There is a hypogonadotrophic state. </p>
                    <p>The pituitary gland is normal and stimulation with exogenous GnRH leads to normal release of gonadotrophins. </p>
                    <p>This condition arises due to a maldevelopment of neurones in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus. These neurones are derived embryologically from the olfactory bulb, and therefore some patients may be unable to smell (anosmia). </p>
                    <p>They are of normal height. </p>

                    <p>Hyperprolactinemia .These cause more of secondary amenorrhea </p>
                    <p>Ovarian failure - from chemotherapy and radiotherapy for childhood malignancies. </p>
                    <p>Galactosaemia - deficiency of galactose-1- phosphate uridyl transferase. The galactose metabolites may induce ovarian failure. </p>

                    <p>PCOS therefore encompasses symptoms of menstrual cycle disturbance and as such is the commonest cause of secondary amenorrhea. </p>
                    <p>The pathophysiology of the PCOS appears to be multifactorial and polygenic. </p>
                    <p>Key features include </p>

                    <p>It is the commonest pituitary cause of amenorrhea. </p>
                    <p>May result from a prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma, or from a non-functioning 'disconnection' tumor in the region of the hypothalamus or pituitary, which disrupts the inhibitory influence of dopamine on prolactin secretion. </p>
                    <p>Mechanism of hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea is probably due to the inhibitory effects of raised prolactin on the pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus thereby blocking the LH surge neede for ovulation and also interfering with the actions of gonadotropins on the ovary itself.</p>
                    <p>Hypothyroidism, polycystic ovary syndrome and drugs e.g. the dopaminergic antagonist phenothiazines, domperidone and metoclopramide. </p>
                    <p>Patients may present with galactorrhea and visual field defects. </p>
                    <p>Investigations- Prolactin assay, lateral skull Xray, CT scan, MRI. Often microadenomas might not appear in initial scans and follow-up scans are required to identify tumors that develop in size later.</p>
                    <p>Treatment- dopamine agonists (bromocriptine, cabergoline), transphenoidal adenectomy, radiotherapy and hormone replacement </p>
