            <p>The floor of the pelvis is the lowest boundary on which all the pelvic and abdominal contents rest.</p>
            <p>The pelvic floor functions to support the pelvic and abdominal viscera and help maintain control of their contents. </p>
            <p>It has two major components which are interdependent: the muscle and fascia.</p>

                  <p>As with other striated muscles its strength can be increased by exercise as with pelvic floor physiotherapy.</p>
                  <p>Contraction of the muscles results in a forward elevation of the pelvic floor which is important in their role in continence. </p>
                  <p>This forward elevation helps to increase the angulation between bladder and urethra anteriorly and rectum and anal canal posteriorly. </p>
                  <p>Increase in this angulation is one of the fundamental mechanisms which aid continence.</p>

            <div class='body'>
                <p>Fascia envelopes levator ani, attaches it to bone at its origin and holds the two muscles together in the midline. The urethra, vagina and rectum perforate this midline fascia.</p>

                </figure>

                <p>The striated muscle of the pelvic floor, in common with other striated muscles throughout the body, undergoes a gradual denervation with age. This denervation will result in a gradual weakening of the muscle over time.</p>
                <p>While some of the aging effect can be counteracted by muscle training, the impact of denervation will be to diminish the number of neurones which can stimulate muscle fibres to contract. </p>
                <p>Pelvic floor muscle denervation is increased by vaginal delivery, particularly if the active second stage of labour is prolonged.</p>
                <p>Thus, the pelvic viscera are supported both by the levator ani muscle below and the fascial attachments which are condensed in some areas and are often referred to as ligaments – the uterosacral, cardinal and round ligaments being examples.</p>

            <p>Especially repeated vaginal deliveries caused by the stretching and tearing of the endopelvic fascia and the levator muscles and perineal body. Partial pudendal and perineal neuropathies are also associated with labour.</p>
            <p>The perineal body (or central tendon of perineum) is a pyramidal fibromuscular mass in the middle line of the perineum at the junction between the urogenital triangle and the anal triangle. In females, it is found between the vagina and anus, and about 1.25 cm in front of the latter.</p>
            <p><span class="special-text-3">Congenital:</span></p>
            <p>Certain rare abnormalities in connective tissue (collagen) e.g. Marfan disease, some women who have increased joint elasticity also have pelvic fascia stretchiness e.g. extreme form is Ehrlers Danlos syndrome.</p>
            <p><span class="special-text-3"> Normal aging:</span></p>
            <p>With increasing age fascial tissues become stiffer and more liable to rupture the fascia of the pelvic floor will provide weaker support with advancing years.</p>
            <p><span class="special-text-3">Endocrine: </span></p>
            <p>Women often declare that prolapse symptoms are worse around the time of menstruation. This is thought to be secondary to higher progesterone levels increased fascial elasticity. Lack of estrogen especially after menopause leading to vagina atrophy.</p>

                    <p>Squeeze the same muscles you would use to stop your urine. Your belly and thighs should not move.</p>
                    <p>Hold the squeeze for 3 seconds, then relax for 3 seconds.</p>
                    <p>Start with 3 seconds, then add 1 second each week until you are able to squeeze for 10 seconds.</p>
                    <p>Repeat the exercise 10 to 15 times a session. Do three or more sessions a day.</p>

                    <p><span class="special-text-3">Pessaries:</span></p>
                    <p>Are removable devices inserted into the vagina that fits under the cervix and helps push up and stabilize the uterus and cervix.</p>
                    <p>They come in different sizes and should be fitted carefully.</p>
                    <p>They are sometimes used to see what the effect of surgery for pelvic organ prolapse will be on urinary symptoms. This is called a "pessary test."</p>
                    <p>If you have a problem with incontinence with a pessary inserted, a separate surgery to fix the incontinence problem may be done at the same time as a prolapse surgery.</p>
                    <p>Pessaries are sometimes used to treat uterine prolapse in young women during pregnancy. In this instance, the pessary holds the uterus in the correct position before it enlarges and becomes trapped in the vaginal canal.</p>
                    <p>Pessaries can be removed daily, weekly, or monthly for washing with regular soap and water. </p>
                    <p>Side effects include: Vaginal erosions or ulcers which if found, pessaries should be removed until the lesions have healed, and affected areas should be treated with topical estrogen.</p>

          <p>There is a 25–30% possibility of prolapse recurrence following surgery. </p>
          <p>Chances of the prolapse recurrence increase in presence of obesity, overweight, constipation, chronic cough or undertaking heavy physical activities.</p>
          <p>Prolapse may also occur in another part of the vagina.</p>
