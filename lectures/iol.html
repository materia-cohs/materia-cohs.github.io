                <p>It is not a complete diagnosis if the cause is not stated e.g. failed induction of labor due to cord prolapse, CPD, fetal distress, etc.</p>

            <p class="tips-card-content">
              <ul>
                <li>It has been shown that the nearness to spontaneous labor by the cervix before induction, the better the outcome. </li>
                <li>Cervical status is accessed using the Bishop score. A favorable score is a score of 6 or more. A score that is less than 6 is unfavorable and cervical ripening will be needed to increase the chance of a successful induction.</li>

            </p>
        </div>

        <p><span class="underlined--offset"><i>The Bishop Score</i></span></p>
        <p>Bishop produced a scoring system to quantify cervical status and how far this process had progressed prior to the Induction of labor.</p>
        <p>High scores (a â€˜favorableâ€™ cervix) are associated with an easier, shorter induction that is less likely to fail.</p>
        <p>Low scores (an â€˜unfavorableâ€™ cervix) point to a longer IOL that is more likely to fail and result in Caesarean section.</p>

            <figcaption>fig. I. Bishop Score </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>There are 5 parameters. The maximum score for two of the parameters is 2 and the maximum score for the remaining three parameters is 3 giving a possible total score of 13.</p>
        <p>Four of the parameters are about the cervix and one is the station of the presenting part. The station is the relationship of the presenting part to the ischial spines. It indicates how far the presenting part has descended into the motherâ€™s pelvis.</p>

                <p>A fluid filled balloon is inserted inside the cervix.  The Balloon provide mechanical pressure directly on the cervix which respond by ripening and dilation. A Foley catheter (26 Fr) or specifically designed balloon devices can be used. </p>
                <p>Technique of balloon placement:</p>
                <p>After sterilization and draping, the catheter is introduced into the endocervix either by direct visualization or blindly by sliding it over fingers through the endocervix into the potential space between the amniotic membrane & the lower uterine segment.</p>
                <p>The balloon is inflated with 30 to 50 ml of normal saline and is retracted so that it rests on the internal Os. </p>
                <p>Catheter is removed at the time of rupture of membranes or may be expelled spontaneously which indicate a cervical dilatation of 3-4 cm.</p>
                <p>If catheter does not fall off after 12-24hours, it can be deflated, removed and repassed after 12 hours</p>

                <p>Stripping the membranes mechanically dilates the cervix which releases prostaglandins.

                <p>The Cochrane reviewers concluded that stripping the membranes, when used as an adjunct, decreases the mean dose of oxytocin needed and increases the rate of normal vaginal deliveries. </p>

                <p>It is started after 38 â€“ 40 weeks and 2 in 3 patients may go into labor within 72 hours.</p>
                <p>It is associated with reduced post-term pregnancy and formal induction.</p>
                <p>Stripping of the membranes causes an increase in the activity of phospholipase and prostaglandin as well as causing mechanical dilation of the cervix, which releases prostaglandins.

                <p>PG increases the activity of collagenase in the cervix also resulting in a softer cervix. </p>
                <p>They cause an increase in elastase, glycosaminoglycan, dermatan sulfate, and hyaluronic acid levels in the cervix. A relaxation of cervical smooth muscle facilitates dilation. </p>
                <p>Prostaglandins allow for an increase in intracellular calcium levels, causing contraction of myometrial muscle.</p>
                <p>Risks associated with the use of prostaglandins include uterine hyperstimulation and maternal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. </p>
                <p>Currently available prostaglandin analogs for the purpose of cervical ripening, dinoprostone gel (CERVIPRIME: 0.5 mg) and dinoprostone inserts (PRIMIPROST: 10 mg); Misoprostol (Cytotec: 25Âµg 4-6hourly).</p>
            </div>

            <p><b>Examples of pharmacologic agents for IOL</b></p>

            <p><span class="special-text">1. Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (dinoprostone):</span></p>
            <p>It is inserted vaginally as a gel (Prepidil), as a removable tampon (Cervidil) or as a vaginal pessary. It acts on the cervical connective tissue and relaxes muscle fibers of the cervix. Dinoprostone should only be administered at hospital and the patient is expected to stay recumbent and monitored, at least, for the first 30 minutes after insertion. Contractions usually start within 60 minutes of commencing induction and peak within 4 hours. If optimal response is not achieved by 6 hours, another dose can be administered. The maximum allowed dose is 3 doses be administered per 24 hours. 	</p>
            <p>Cervidil contains 10 mg of dinoprostone and provides a lower constant release of medication (0.3 mg per hour) than Prepidil does. Cervidil have the advantage of being removed more easily if uterine hyperstimulation occurs. In addition, it does not require refrigeration. </p>
            <p>PGE<sub>2</sub> can cause uterine hyperstimulation, fetal distress.</p>

            <p><span class="special-text">2. Misoprostol:</span></p>
            <p><i>Pharmacokinetics:</i></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Route of administration: Oral, vaginal and sublingual route for induction. All that is required is a mucous membrane for absorption.</li>
              <li>Bioavailability: Extensively absorbed from the GIT</li>
              <li>Metabolism: De-esterified to prostaglandin F analogs</li>
              <li>Half-life: <span class="special-text-3">20â€“40 minutes</span></li>
              <li>Excretion: Mainly renal 80%, remainder is fecal: 15%</li>
              <li>Misoprostol (Cytotec) is a synthetic PGE<sub>1</sub> analog that has been found to be a safe and inexpensive agent for cervical ripening. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Clinical trials indicate that the safe optimal dose and dosing interval is <span class="special-text-3">25 mcg</span> intravaginally every <span class="special-text-3">4-6 hours</span>. <span class="underlined--offset">A maximum of <span class="special-text-3">4-6 doses</span></span> was suggested. Higher doses or shorter dosing intervals are associated with a higher incidence of side effects, especially uterine hyperstimulation.</p>
            <p>Misoprostol should not be used in women with previous CS because of increased rates of uterine rupture and also in women with previous precipitate labor because misoprostol itself can cause precipitate labor. Mechanical methods can be used to ripen the cervix and oxytocin used for induction in women with previous precipitate labor; mechanical methods are preferred to pharmacologic methods because they are easier to control.</p>
            <p>The Cochrane reviewers concluded that use of misoprostol resulted in an overall lower incidence of CS. In addition, there appears to be a higher incidence of vaginal delivery within 24 hours of application and a reduced need for oxytocin augmentation</p>

              <p>Mifepristone (Mifeprex) is an antiprogesterone agent which counteracts the inhibitory effect of Progesterone on the uterus. Few studies with small number of women enrolled, have shown that women treated with mifepristone in a dose of <span class="special-text-3">600 mg</span> are more likely to have a favorable cervix and deliver within <span class="special-text-3">48 to 96 hours</span> when compared with placebo and also they these were less likely to undergo CS. </p>
              <p>Information about fetal outcomes and maternal side effects is scarce and cannot be used to recommend the use of mifepristone for cervical ripening.</p>

                <p>It is given by <span class="special-text"><i></i>IV infusion</span> using an automated pump. Oxytocin has many advantages: it is potent and easy to titrate, has a short half-life (one to five minutes) and is well tolerated. Ideally, <span class="special-text-3">10 IU</span> Oxytocin in <span class="special-text-3">1 litre</span> of IVF recommended. It is used only for induction not cervical ripening, so the cervix must have been ripened e.g. by mechanical methods before infusion. Oxytocin infusion should not be given to a woman with an intact membrane, it increases the risk of embolism especially amniotic fluid embolism.</p>
                <p><span class="special-text-3">5 IU</span> of oxytocin in <span class="special-text-3">500 mL</span> <span class="special-text">5% dextrose</span> can also be used. </p>
                <p>Usually titrated with the uterine contractions till adequate contractions are established i.e. <span class="special-text-3">3 contractions</span>/<span class="special-text-3">10 minutes</span>, each lasts between <span class="special-text-3">45-60 seconds</span> e.g. 10, 20, 30â€¦ 60 or 15, 30, 45, 60 drops/min. </p>
                <p>Incremental interval should be 30 or 45 minutes.</p>
                <p>If at 60d/min contractions remain inadequate, discard the solution and prepare a higher concentration e.g. 10IU in 500ml of 5% dextrose.</p>
                <p>The ideal fluids are</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Ringers lactate</li>
                  <li>Normal saline</li>
                  <li>5% dextrose saline</li>
                </ul>
                Dextrose water should not be used as it increases the risk if some complications.
                <p>This protocol have the advantage of less hyperstimulation but with long induction delivery interval.</p>

                <p><b>Oxytocin Protocol:</b></p>
                <p>If infusion volumes were found to be excessive, prepare double strength solution. </p>
                <p>If no progress occurred after 8â€“12 hours of starting induction, either discontinue the oxytocin and reapply a cervical ripening agent or re-initiate oxytocin the next day. </p>
                <p>Continuous electronic FHR monitoring during induction is essential to monitor fetal response to labor and uterine response to the inducing agent. If severe FHR abnormalities or hyperstimulation occurred, decrease/discontinue the oxytocin infusion. </p>

                <p><b>Side effects of oxytocin use:</b></p>
                <p>Uterine hyperstimulation and subsequent FHR abnormalities.</p>
                <p>Uterine rupture.</p>
                <p>Water intoxication may occur with high concentrations of oxytocin infused with large quantities of hypotonic solutions. Therefore, AVOID prolonged administration and infusion of fluids in any 10 hours should not exceed 1500 ml. A rapid intravenous injection of oxytocin may cause hypotension</p>
