            <h4><span class="special-text">Why this topic? </span></h4>
            <p>Good care before and during pregnancy is important for the health of the mother and the development of the unborn baby.  </p>
            <p>Pregnancy is a crucial time to promote healthy behaviors and parenting skills.  </p>
            <p>Good ANC links the woman and her family with the formal health system, increases the chance of using a skilled attendant at birth and contributes to good health through the life cycle. </p>
            <p>Inadequate care during this time breaks a critical link in the continuum of care, and affects both women and babies.</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Definitions  </span></h4>
            <p>Pre-conception: Before pregnancy </p>
            <p>Antenatal = prenatal:  occurring before or existing before birth; i.e. during pregnancy</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Background  </span></h4>
            <p>Pregnancy and childbirth are major life events.</p>
            <p>Preconception and antenatal care improve prospects of safe motherhood. </p>
            <p>Continuum of care: Preconception careâ€”Antenatal careâ€”Postnatal careâ€”Care of the newborn</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Preconception care </span></h4>
            <p>Specialized form of care (For who? When? Why?)</p>
            <p>For women of reproductive age (and men) before onset of pregnancy to detect treat or counsel about pre-existing medical or social conditions that may militate against safe motherhood/delivery of a healthy baby.</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Aim  </span></h4>
            <p>To obtain the best possible pregnancy outcome by helping the mother to maintain her well-being and achieve a healthy outcome for herself and her infant.</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Maternal mortality </span></h4>
            <p>Definition: death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management but not from accidental or incidental causes.  (WHO, ICD-10)</p>
            <p>600,000 women annually worldwide </p>
            <p>95% in developing countries </p>
            <p>80% of deaths are preventable </p>
            <p>Nigeria accounts for about 20% of global maternal deaths </p>
            <p>Preconception, ANC and maternal mortality? What is the relationship?</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Causes of Maternal Deaths </span></h4>
            <p>Direct: As a consequence of a disorder specific to pregnancy e.g. Hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia </p>
            <p>Indirect: resulting from previous existing disease(s) that developed during pregnancy, and which were not due to direct obstetric causes but aggravated by pregnancy e.g. Cardiac disease, DM </p>
            <p>Coincidental: Incidental/accidental deaths/non-obstetric; deaths during pregnancy but not due to pregnancy or aggravated by pregnancy e.g. Road traffic accident. </p>
            <p>Late: Deaths occurring > 42 days but < 1 year after the end of pregnancy.</p>
            <p>Preconception and antenatal care can help to reduce both direct and indirect causes of maternal mortality.</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Lifetime risk of maternal death </span></h4>
            <p>The probability that a 15-year-old girl will die from complications of pregnancy or childbirth over her lifetime.</p>
            <p>In a high-fertility setting, a woman faces the risk of maternal death multiple times, and her lifetime risk of death will be higher than in a low-fertility setting. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>In South Sudan 1: 18  </li>
                <li>Nigeria 1: 21  </li>
                <li>Niger: 1 in 27 </li>
                <li>In Italy 1: 51,300 (lowest in the world). ? US: 1 in 3000 </li>
                <li>UK: 1 in 8,400 </li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Maternal mortality ratio and rate </span></h4>
            <p>Maternal mortality ratio (MMR): the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes).  </p>
            <p>Maternal mortality rate: is the number of maternal deaths (direct and indirect) in a given period per 100,000 women of reproductive age during the same time period.</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Infant Mortality  </span></h4>
            <p>Death of infant < 1 year </p>
            <p>50% of all infant deaths occur in the first week of life </p>
            <p>Leading causes of infant mortality are birth defects, prematurity/LBW and SIDS </p>
            <p>Nigeria has the third highest still birth rate and neonatal death rate in the world </p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">What is the role of preconception and ANC in reducing these adverse outcomes?</span></h4>
            <p>The preconception movement is based on the realization that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Prenatal care starts too late to prevent many of poor pregnancy outcomes.</li>
                <li>Women who have higher levels of health before pregnancy have healthier reproductive outcomes.</li>
                <li>In obstetrics, many of our outcomes or their determinants are present before we ever meet our patients.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text">How can preconception and antenatal care help to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality? </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring optimal health prior to pregnancy.</li>
                <li>Identifying and managing conditions in pre-pregnant state that may negatively affect pregnancy outcome.</li>
                <li>Provision of prophylaxis during pregnancy </li>
                <li>Early identification and appropriate management of complications </li>
                <li>Increasing skilled attendants at delivery</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Objectives of preconception care  </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Screening  </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>For medical conditions</li>
                    <li>If present, ensure good control </li>
                    <li>For viral infections like HIV, hepatitis, rubella </li>
                </ul>
                <li>Avoidance of maternal exposure to teratogens during the period of organogenesis</li>
                <li>Ensure healthy lifestyle </li>
                <li>Provide nutritional supplements  </li>
                <li>Introduce potential mothers to social and medical interventions at a time when it will have a maximal effect on pregnancy outcome e.g. preconception folic acid to reduce NTD</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text">4 goals of Preconception Care (Centre for disease control/select panel for preconception care (CDC/SPPC) </span></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>To improve the knowledge, attitudes and behavior of women and men related to preconception health </li>
                <li>Ensure that all women of child-bearing age in the US receive preconception care services (i.e. evidence-based risk screening, health promotion and intervention) that will enable them to enter pregnancy in optimal health</li>
                <li>Reduce risks indicated by a previous adverse pregnancy outcome through interventions during the inter-conception period, which can prevent or minimize health problems for a mother and her future children </li>
                <li>Reduce disparities in adverse pregnancy outcomes</li>
            </ol>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Context  </span></h4>
            <p>Certain pre-existing conditions become worse during pregnancy and could contribute to the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcome to the mother or the child. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maternal morbidity or mortality </li>
                <li>Perinatal morbidity or mortality</li>

                <li>Follow up</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Risk assessment </span></h4>
            <p>Concept of risk factors: presence of risk factors increase the probability of having an adverse outcome </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most women with adverse outcome are high risk </li>
                <li>Not all women with risk factors will have an adverse outcome </li>
                <li>Some women without any risk factor will end up having an adverse outcome</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Continuous evaluation of risk status before and during pregnancy during labor and in the puerperium will enable early detection of problems allowing timely management and improved outcome.</p>

            <p>Placental implantation begins 5 days after fertilization and is complete by days 9-10â€” before most women know they are pregnant. </p>
            <p>The most critical period for development of structural anomalies is days 17-56 after fertilization i.e. organogenesis begins just 3 days after the first missed mensesâ€”before most  women can get into prenatal care. </p>
            <p>A critical period for the prevention of poor pregnancy outcomes has already passed by the time of the first antenatal visit.</p>

            <p>Make a plan; have a reproductive life plan </p>
            <p>Healthy livingâ€”stop smoking, alcohol</p>
            <p>Avoid exposure to toxic substances (including alcohol and drug) </p>
            <p>Knowledge and information about STI/HIV; prevention and treatment</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Ten recommendations to improve preconception health (CDC/SPCC) </span></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Individual responsibility across the lifespan. Encourage each woman and every couple to have a reproductive life plan </li>
                <li>Consumer awareness. Increase public awareness of the importance of preconception health behavior and use of preconception care services </li>
                <li>Preventive visits: as part of primary care visits, provide risk assessment and counselling to all women of childbearing age to reduce risks related to pregnancy outcomes </li>
                <li>Interventions for identified risks: increase the proportion of women who receive interventions as follow up to preconception risk screening focusing on high priority interventions</li>
                <li>Inter-conception care: use the inter-conception period to provide intensive interventions to women who had a prior pregnancy ending in an adverse outcome (e.g. infant death, low birth weight, or preterm birth) </li>
                <li>Pre-pregnancy checkups: offer as a component of maternity care, one pre pregnancy visit for couples planning a pregnancy </li>
                <li>Health coverage for low income women to improve access to preventive womenâ€™s health, preconception and inter-conception care  </li>
                <li>Public health programs and strategies. Integrate components of preconception health into existing local public health and related programs including emphasis on women with previous adverse outcomes </li>
                <li>Research  </li>
                <li>Monitoring improvements. Maximize public health surveillance and related research mechanisms to monitor pre-conception health</li>
            </ol>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Constraints  </span></h4>
            <p>Most pregnancies are unplanned </p>
            <p>Lack of motivation; skepticism about the values of preconception care </p>
            <p>Feel they are healthy </p>
            <p>No formal setup </p>
            <p>Time, cost, logistics</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Way out </span></h4>
            <p>Physicianâ€™s role: active participation of all health workers because all women of reproductive age are candidates for preconception care.</p>
            <p>Womanâ€™s roleâ€”all women can benefit from preconception care by taking good care of their health and maintaining healthy habits irrespective of whether or not they are planning a pregnancy.</p>

                <li>In addition, as indirect causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, such as HIV and malaria infections, contribute to approximately 25% of maternal deaths and near-misses, ANC provides an opportunity to prevent and manage concurrent diseases.  </li>

            <ul>
                <li>Critical healthcare functions (health promotion, prevention, screening and diagnosis of diseases).  </li>
                <li>Implementing timely and appropriate evidence-based practices which can improve maternal and fetal health.  </li>
                <li>Communicate with and support of women, families and communities at this very pivotal time in the course of their lives.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Context:</p>
            <p>Certain preexisting conditions become worse during pregnancy and could contribute to the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcome to the mother or the child resulting inâ€”</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maternal morbidity or mortality </li>
                <li>Perinatal morbidity or mortality</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Risk assessment </span></h4>
            <p>Presence of risk factors increase the probability of having an adverse outcome </p>
            <p>Most women with adverse outcome are high risk </p>
            <p>Not all women with risk factors will have an adverse outcome</p>
            <p>Some women without any risk factor will end up having an adverse outcome</p>
            <p>Continuous evaluation of risk status before and during pregnancy, during labor and in the puerperium will enable early detection of problems allowing timely management and improved outcome</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Historical perspective of ANC </span></h4>
            <p>Steeped in rituals and taboos </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Greece: Exercise in pregnancy results in delivery of better warriors </li>
                <li>Rome: strong and violent movements induce membrane rupture </li>
                <li>Hanging clothes to dry on a clothes line increase the risk of cord wrapping round the babyâ€™s neck</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Began as a social service in France in 1788 for the destitute. </p>
            <p>Women were housed from the 36th week until delivery in cramped hostels. </p>
            <p>Emphasis was on treatment, not prevention. </p>
            <p>Complicated cases were admitted into general wards.  </p>
            <p>1st organized prenatal care in US in 1901 with nurse home visits </p>

            <p>Goal of early prenatal care:  diagnose and treat preeclampsia in order to decrease maternal mortality.</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Aims of Antenatal Care (ANC)  </span></h4>
            <p>Prompt detection, modification or management of pre-existing conditions or risk factors that may influence the course and outcome of pregnancy and labor </p>
            <p>Provision of health education on the events of pregnancy, labor and puerperium </p>
            <p>Immunization and chemoprophylaxis against common diseases that may influence maternal or fetal wellbeing and pregnancy outcome</p>
            <p>ANC helps to prepare for birth and parenthood as well as prevent, detect, alleviate, or manage the three types of health problems during pregnancy that affect mothers and babies viz: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complications of pregnancy itself </li>
                <li>Pre-existing conditions that worsen during pregnancy </li>
                <li>Effects of unhealthy lifestyles</li>
            </ul>
            <p>ANC involvesâ€”</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Close monitoring of maternal wellbeing and fetal growth and wellbeing through-out pregnancy </li>
                <li>Detection and modification of conditions that may be pregnancy induced that can influence materno-fetal outcome e.g. gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), urinary tract infection (UTI)  </li>
                <li>Education regarding pregnancy related conditions, what to expect, danger signs </li>
                <li>Determination of the timing and mode of delivery of the fetus  </li>
                <li>Healthcare functions, including health promotion, screening and diagnosis, and disease prevention</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text">Benefits of ANC  </span></h4>
            <p>Key entry point to receive broad range of health promotion and preventive health services. </p>
            <p>Opportunity to promote benefits of skilled attendance at birth. </p>
            <p>Ideal opportunity to counsel women about benefits of child spacing. </p>
            <p>Essential link in the household-to-hospital care continuum. </p>
            <p>Reduces maternal morbidity and mortality </p>
            <p>Improves survival and health of babies directly by reducing SBs and NNDs deaths.</p>

                   <p>Background: In 2016, at the start of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) era, pregnancy-related preventable morbidity and mortality remains unacceptably high.</p>
                   <p>While substantial progress has been made, countries need to consolidate and increase these advances, and to expand their agendas to go beyond survival, with a view to maximizing the health and potential of their populations</p>
                   <p>Recent evidence suggests that the FANC model, which was developed in the 1990s, is associated with more perinatal deaths than models comprising at least eight ANC contacts.</p>
                   <p>A secondary analysis of the WHO ANC trial suggested that the increase in perinatal mortality is more likely to be due to increased stillbirths</p>
                   <p>New guidance recommends a minimum of eight contacts between the pregnant woman and the healthcare providers.</p>
                   <p>Contacts during the third trimester are critical time points that may allow assessment of well-being and interventions to reduce stillbirths.</p>
                   <p>Evidence suggests that an increase in the number of antenatal care contacts, seems to be associated with an increase in maternal satisfaction compared with fewer ANC contacts.</p>
