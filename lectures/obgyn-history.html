                    <p>Why do we clerk?</p>
                    <p>To arrive at a diagnosis and plan management.</p>
                    <p>It is the critical first step in determining the etiology of a problem.</p>
                    <p>In 70% of cases, diagnosis can be reached from history alone.</p>
                    <p>We do this by asking questions that are relevant, comprehensive and to the point.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use open-ended questions.</li>
                        <li>Limit leading questions.</li>
                        <li>Remember to enquire about traditional and medical remedies used.</li>
                        <li>Also enquire about life events that may affect patient’s health.</li>
                        <li>After asking your questions, ask for clarification or summarize history of presenting complaints if necessary.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Tools required in history taking include the ability to-</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Listen</li>
                        <li>Ask common sense questions</li>
                        <li>An interplay of interpersonal skills, analytical skills and knowledge of medicine</li>
                        <li>A vast knowledge base is required to know the right questions to ask at specific times, this knowledge will be acquired over time.</li>
                    </ul>
                    

                    <pWhat are the peculiaries of obstetrics patients?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pregnancy is a physiologic state not a pathologic state.</li>
                            <li>Patients are usually healthy.</li>
                            <li>Two patients in one- mother and fetus.</li>
                            <li>Balance maternal and fetal outcome.</li>
                            <li>The aim of antenatal clinic is to have a healthy infant and mother at the end of pregnancy.</li>

                    <p>Dress smartly and professionally. First impressions last longest.</p>

                    <p>Greet patient and establish a good rapport.</p>
                    <p>Introduce yourself in a friendly manner, explain what you are about to do e.g. I am a medical student and I would like to ask you a few questions about yourself and your pregnancy. Is that OK? Or can I go ahead?</p>
                    <p>‘Her story’ the history should be reported as much as possible in patient's own words.</p>
                    <p>Be understanding, non-judgmental, receptive, use verbal and non-verbal cues (eye-contact, nodding, etc).</p>
                    <p>Demonstrate sensitivity to religious and traditional beliefs.</p>
                    <p>Try to be efficient and time conscious; focus on main problem and don't feel compelled to ask every single question on the list.  </p>
                    <p>Remember to document date and time, name/signature at the end.</p>
