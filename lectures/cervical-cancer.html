            <p>Cancer of the cervix is a malignant tumor of the epithelial linings of the cervix.</p>
            <p>The Cervix is the lowermost part of the uterus, a cylindrical-shaped structure composed of stroma and epithelium. </p>
            <p>The intravaginal part, the ectocervix, projects into the vagina and is lined by squamous epithelium. </p>
            <p>The endocervical canal extends from the internal os at the junction with the uterus to the external os which opens into the vagina and is lined by columnar epithelium. </p>
            <p>Almost all cases of cervical carcinoma originate in the transformation zone from the ecto-or endocervical mucosa. </p>
            <p>The transformation zone is the area of the cervix between the old and new squamocolumnar junction.</p>
            <p>The fact that the cervix can be easily visualized and sampled, and can be treated by freezing and burning with little or no anesthesia, has contributed to the understanding of the natural history of this cancer along with the development of simple outpatient techniques of screening and prevention</p>

            <p>Lined by stratified squamous epithelium on the ectocervix and columnar epithelium on the endocervix.</p>
            <p>The Squamo-Colomnar junction (SCJ) appears as a sharp line with a step due to difference in height of the stratified squamous & the mucin-secreting columnar epithelium</p>
            <p>Location in relation to external os is variable</p>
            <p>Original SCJ – junction between columnar epithelium and squamous epithelium laid down during embryo development, not seen at birth.</p>
            <p>Original SCJ is up at or very close to internal os during childhood and perimenarche.</p>
            <p>It thus becomes located in the cervical canal, far away from the external os.</p>
            <p>After puberty & during reproductive period – oestrogen – growth of genital organs – cervix swells & enlarges – endocervical canal elongates.</p>
            <p>The new SCJ now moves down and is located on the ectocervix.</p>
            <p>Again, this is reversed with, age & shrinking of the genital organs, the new SCJ withdraws moving backwards towards the internal os. </p>
            <p>At menopause, it lies completely within the endocervical canal and is often invisible on visual examination.</p>

            <p>Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is central to the development of cervical neoplasia. (HPV 16 and 18). Persistent high risk HPV (hrHPV) infection is a necessary but not sufficient cause. HPV leads to progressive changes in the cervical epithelium that can be detected before frank malignancy. </p>
            <p>Persistence HPV infection occurs in only 4 – 12%. </p>
            <p>Almost all African women are infected by HPV at some point in their lives</p>
            <p>In most populations, prevalence peaks soon after sexual debut, then falls</p>
            <p>In Africa, the fall in prevalence is shallower and high prevalence continues well into adult life</p>
            <p>Prevalence of HPV infection and multiple infection is high</p>

            <p>In HIV immuno-Incompetent women the development of cervical cancer precursors occurs at a younger age and the progression to cancer may be quicker. They are more likely to have persistent HPV infection</p>
            <p>Generally, cancer of the cervix is a slowly developing process that could last 10 to 15 years.</p>
            <p>Most probably begin as a high-grade intraepithelial lesion or carcinoma in situ with gradual progression over a period of several years</p>
            <p>At least 90% of squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix develop from the intraepithelial layers</p>

            <p>Cervical cancers are usually precesded by a long phase of preinvasive disease. There are low grade and high grade lesions before progression to invasive cancer.</p>
            <p>The process is initiated by infection with a virus – the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV).</p>
            <p>Almost always within 1cm of the squamo-columnar junction of the cervix either on the portio vaginalis of the cervix or slightly higher in the endocervical canal.</p>
            <p>Early stromal invasion (stage1A1) is a localized process, provided there is no pathologic evidence of lymphovascular space involvement.</p>
            <p>When lymphatics are involved, tumor cells are carried to the regional pelvic lymph nodes (parametrial, hypogastric, obturator, external iliac and sacral)</p>
            <p>The more extensive the local disease, the greater the likelihood of lymph node involvement.</p>
            <p>As the tumor grows, it also spreads by direct extension to the parametria.</p>
            <p>The more advanced the local disease, the greater the likelihood of distant metastases</p>
            <p>Ovarian involvement is rare. The liver and the lungs are the most common sites of blood borne metastases, but the tumor may involve the brain, bones, bowels, adrenal glands, spleen or pancreas. </p>
            <p>Where cancer of the cervix is untreated or fails to respond to treatment, death occurs in 95% of patients within 2 years after the onset of symptoms.</p>
            <p>Death can occur from uremia, pulmonary embolism, or hemorrhage from direct extension into blood vessels. Life threatening sepsis from complications of pyelonephritis or vesico-vaginal and rectovaginal fistulas is possible.</p>
            <p>Large bowel obstuction from direct extension of tumour into the rectosigmoid colon can be the terminal event.</p>
            <p>Pain from perineural extension is a significant management problem of advanced disease.</p>

            <p>The progressive development of cellular changes from HPV infection to cervical cancer is shown visually below. It starts with infection of the basal cell layers of the epithelium by HPV. The whole process generally takes about 10–20 years although, in a very few cases, it may only take 1–2 years. CIN I changes can arise within 3 months of infection, CIN II within 6 months and CIN III within 1–2 years. </p>
            <p>Cytological screening works by detecting cells scraped from the surface of these lesions, which are then classified as LSIL or HSIL by cytology. In addition, there are cytology categories of ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance) for abnormal cell changes thought to show possible minor, low-grade changes and ASC-H for abnormal cells that might show high-grade abnormality. There is also a pathway to glandular (adeno) carcinoma that includes adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS).</p>
            <p>Ostor (1993) reviewed the literature on the natural regression, persistence and progression of pre-cancerous cervical lesions. </p>
            <p>He calculated the approximate likelihood of regression of CIN I was 57%, persistence 32%, progression to CIN III 11% and progression to invasion 1%.  The corresponding approximations for CIN II were 43%, 35%, 22% and 5% respectively. And the likelihood of CIN 3 regressing was 32% and progressing to invasion greater than 12%.  There are other studies estimating different percentages of regression, progression and persistence, but the overall message is that the more advanced the pre-cancerous lesions are, the more likely they will be to progress to invasive cervical cancer. </p>

                    <p>Mortality remains high at 50% world wide- late presentation, advanced stage of disease and in some areas there is no functioning screening process</p>
                    <p>The precursors of cervical cancer can be detected and treated.</p>
                    <p>A public health service  in which members of a defined population, who do not necessarily perceive that they are at risk of or are already affected by a disease or its complications are asked a question or offered a test, to identify those individuals who are more likely to be helped than harmed by further tests or treatment to reduce the risk of a disease or its complications.</p>

                    <h4><span class="special-text-4">Who should be screened?</span></h4>
                    <p>All asymptomatic women from the age of 21 to 70yrs.</p>

Rates have also decreased in high-risk areas, including China, Taiwan, Korea, and India, in part due to improved screening activities and socioeconomic conditions, options for cervical cancer screening.</p>

          <p>Although, considered preventable, with the limited health resources in our environment, it remains a significant cause of mortality. </p>
          <p>All the studies showed the women to be multiparous with average parity varying from 5.6 (Ekanem) to 6.5 (Banjo).</p>
          <p>While studies from Zaria showed most women to have had multiple marriages, studies from Benin did not reveal that the patients had multiple partners.</p>
          <p>The age range for cervical cancer varied from 23-85 years in Ilorin, 27-80 years in Lagos. Recent studies and observation have shown cases to occur in women as young as 17 years.</p>
          <p>Majority of the patients were in the age range 40-55 and the average age incidence was found to be 51.8 years in Ilorin, 52.4 years in Lagos. The lowest average age incidence of 17yrs was recorded in Ibadan. Similar age presentation was also recently recorded in Lagos.</p>
