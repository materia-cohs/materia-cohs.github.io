            <p>The dictum ‚ÄúOnce a caesarean always a caesarean‚Äù has largely permeated the obstetric practice for most of the twentieth century and today the term Vaginal Birth After Caesarean (VBAC) refers to delivery of an infant through the vagina in a female who has had a prior cesarean section.</p>
            <p>So, in reality VBAC is ‚Äúthe desirable outcome‚Äù and not an intervention/or practice.</p>
            <p>Since VBAC is the outcome, the practice or interventions are now been referred to as ‚Äútrial of labour after previous caesarean delivery‚Äù (TOLAC).</p>
            <p>So patients desiring VBAC delivery undergo a TOLAC.</p>
            <p>Therefore, TOLAC provides women who had a prior caesarean with an opportunity to achieve a vaginal birth after caesarean</p>
            <p>However VBAC and TOLAC are sometimes used synonymously. </p>
            <p>The term VBAC was introduced in 1991 and the practice was endorsed by both the NIH and the WHO through consensus meetings in the 1980s as a strategy to reduce the rising caesarean delivery rates seen in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
            <p>Since then, the incidence of VBAC has increased from 5% in 1985 to 28.3% in 1996.</p>

            <p>Individual level: lower risk of maternal morbidity and fewer complications in future pregnancies.</p>
            <p>Population level: overall decrease in caesarean delivery.</p>
            <p>However, either elective repeat caesarean delivery (ERCD) or TOLAC have associated risk and medical decision making should be guided by evidence with patient engagement in understanding the associated risk.</p>
            <p>Risks to consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Uterine scar dehiscence or rupture</li>

            <p>Considerations for future pregnancies and the impact of repeat/multiple caesarean sections are critical:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Risk of hysterectomy increases with each additional caesarean delivery.</li>
                <li>Placenta previa: risk of placenta previa increases with each additional caesarean delivery.</li>
                <li>Placenta accreta: risk of accreta increases significantly after 2 or more prior caesarean deliveries.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This implies that future morbidity are significantly higher with repeated caesarean sections.</p>
            <p>Risk of maternal death is higher for ERCD at 13.4 per 100,000 compared to 3.8 per 100,000 TOLAC.</p>

            <p><span class="special-text">Who are the ideal candidates for TOLAC/VBAC?</span></p>
            <p>ACOG recent practice bulletin on VBAC recommended that ‚Äúmost women with one previous CS with a low transverse incision are candidates for and should be counseled about VBAC and offered TOLAC‚Äù</p>
            <p>The strongest predictors of VBAC are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Previous vaginal delivery prior to CS predicts about 83% success of VBAC.</li>
                <li>Prior VBAC predicts subsequent success of VBAC by 94%.</li>
                <li>There is a positive correlation between number of prior VBACs and the likelihood of achieving VBAC in the current pregnancy:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>0 (63%) </li>
                    <li>1 (87.6%) </li>
                    <li>2 (90.9%) </li>
                    <li>3 or more (90.6-91.6%)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Nonrecurring indications such as fetal distress, malpresentation positively predicts success</li>
                <li>Previous CS was indicated by cephalopelvic disproportion, failure to progress/active phase arrest, labor dystocia, arrest of descent, the likelihood of achieving VBAC was 54% (48-60%).</li>
                <li>Estimated fetal weight ‚â•4.0kg reduces odds of achieving VBAC by 39-51% relative to women with smaller babies.</li>
                <li>As gestational age increases the likelihood of VBAC decreases particularly when pregnancy progresses beyond 41 weeks.</li>

            <p>The following factors are associated with lower likelihood of achieving success in VBAC:</p>

                <li>Race/ethnicity (Hispanic and African American compared to non-Hispanic whites)</li>

                <li>Cervical status at admission and VBAC: advanced cervical dilatation > 4cm, advanced effacement, in spontaneous labor increases the likelihood of achieving VBAC by 2 fold (OR=2.2; CI: 1.7-2.8).</li>
