            <p>Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder due to either insulin deficiency (relative or absolute) or due to peripheral tissue resistance (decreased sensitivity) to the action of insulin.</p>
            <p>Diabetes mellitus is an endocrine disorder of carbohydrate metabolism, resulting from the lack of action of hormone insulin, produced by the pancreatic Œ≤cells, in the body</p>
            <p>The pathophysiology involved are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decreased sensitivity of skeletal muscles and liver to insulin (insulin resistance) and </li>
                <li>Inadequate secretion of insulin (Œ≤ cell dysfunction) </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The defect lies both in insulin secretion and action </p>
            <p>The ultimate effect is the hyperglycemia</p>
            <p>Due to insulin deficiency, the body is unable to utilize glucose efficiently and is associated with the development of symptoms like polyphagia, polyuria, polydipsia, nocturia, weight loss, exhaustion, electrolyte imbalance, etc.</p>
            <p>About 2% to 5% of the total pregnancies may be affected by diabetes.</p>
            <p>Among pregnancies complicated by diabetes, about 65% cases involve gestational diabetes, whereas 35% cases are associated with pre-existing diabetes, of which 25% of cases may be associated with pre-existing type 1 diabetes; and 10% may involve pre-existing type 2 diabetes.</p>
            <p>Depending on the time of onset of diabetes, women can be classified into two types:</p>
            <p>Women with pre-gestational diabetes: Pregnant women in whom diabetes had been diagnosed before pregnancy</p>
            <p>Women with gestational diabetes: Pregnant women in whom diabetes is diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy</p>
            <p>Nearly 50 percent of women with GDM will become overt diabetes (type-2) over a period of 5 to 20 years.</p>

               <p>Repeat and random urine samples taken on one or more occasions throughout pregnancy reveal glycosuria in about 5‚Äì50 percent cases.</p>
               <p>During pregnancy, <span class="underlined--offset">renal threshold is diminished</span> due to the combined effect of <span class="underlined--offset">increased glomerular filtration and impaired tubular reabsorption of glucose</span>. </p>
               <p>It is present most commonly in mid-pregnancy.</p>
               <p>If glucose test is done, glucose leaks out in the urine even though the blood sugar level is well below 180 mg per 100 mL (normal renal threshold). </p>
               <p>No treatment is required and the condition disappears after delivery.</p>
               <p>Glycosuria is specifically detected by testing a second fasting morning specimen of urine, collected a little later, after discarding the overnight urine.</p>
               <p>Fasting glycosuria if present, is ominous.</p>
               <p>Glycosuria on one occasion before 20th week and on two or more occasions, thereafter, is an indication for glucose tolerance test.</p>
               <p>Glycosuria occurring any time during pregnancy with a positive family history of diabetes or past history of having a baby weighing 4 kg or more should be similarly investigated.</p>

                   <p>The method employed is by using 50 gm oral glucose challenge test without regard to time of day or last meal, between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
                   <p> A plasma glucose value of 140 mg percent (7.8mmol/l) or that of whole blood of 130 mg percent  (7.2mmol/l) at 1 hour is considered as cut off point for consideration of a 100 gm (WHO ‚Äì‚Äâ75 gm) glucose tolerance test.</p>

                  <h4><span class="special-text-4">Preconceptional counselling: </span></h4>
                  <p>Goal is to achieve tight control of diabetes before the onset of pregnancy </p>
                  <p>All diabetic women are managed in a multidisciplinary combined obstetric and diabetic clinic with specialist obstetrician, diabetologist, specialist midwife, pediatrician and dietician.</p>
                  <p>Fetal congenital malformations are significantly low (0.8-2%) in women who receive preconceptional counselling.</p>
                  <p>Women are taught on self-glucose monitoring.</p>
                  <p>Appropriate advice about diet and insulin is given.</p>
                  <p>Chance of having a diabetic child is about <span class="special-text-3">1-3%</span> when the mother is only diabetic, <span class="special-text-3">6%</span> when father is only diabetic, rising to <span class="special-text-3">20%</span> if both the parents are diabetic.</p>

                  <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Principles in the management are:</span></h4>
                  <p>Careful antenatal supervision and glycemic control, so as to maintain the glucose level as near to physiological level as possible. </p>
                  <p>Determine optimum time and method of delivery </p>
                  <p>Arrangement for the care of the newborn</p>

                  <h4><span class="special-text-4">Antenatal care</span></h4>
                  <p>Antenatal supervision should be at monthly intervals up to 20 weeks and thereafter at 2 weeks intervals.</p>
                  <p>At times patient needs admission for stabilization of blood glucose and for monitoring the fetus.</p>
                  <p>Diet‚Äî30 Kcal/kg for normal weight women, 24 Kcal/kg for overweight women and 12 Kcal/kg for morbidly obese women.</p>
                  <p>If values are exceeded even on diet, insulin therapy is suggested.</p>
                  <p>Diet should contain carbohydrate 50%, protein 20% and fat 25-30%.</p>
                  <p>Fat may be curtailed, if the patient is obese.</p>
                  <p>Fiber containing diet is increased.</p>
                  <p>Usually three meal regimen, with breakfast 25% of the total calorie intake, lunch 30%, dinner 30% and several snacks are quite suitable for most of the patients.</p>
                  <p>Frequent blood sugar estimation.</p>
                  <p>Monitoring of blood glucose by glucose meter can give an accurate idea about the control.</p>
                  <p>Glycosylated hemoglobin should be determined at the end of first trimester and trimonthly thereafter - HbAIc level of <6% is desirable.</p>
                  <p> Sonographic evaluation (Level II) in pregnancy (at 3-4 weeks interval) is extremely helpful, not only to diagnose varieties of congenital malformation of fetus but also to detect fetal macrosomia or growth restriction (rare).</p>
                  <p>Assessment of fetal well-being is to be made from 28 weeks onwards.</p>
                  <p>Biophysical profile and NST should be performed weekly.</p>
                  <p>Doppler umbilical artery velocimetry is useful in cases with vasculopathy.</p>

                  <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Role of ultrasound</span></h4>
                  <p>Preferably done in first trimester to confirm gestational age by dates.</p>
                  <p>Repeated at 18 to 20 weeks gestation to evaluate the fetus for congenital anomalies.</p>
                  <p>Particularly important in patients with pre-existing type 1 and 2 diabetes and elevated first trimester HbA1c (>6.5%)</p>
                  <p>Should be done at 30 to 32 weeks and 36-38 weeks of gestation to evaluate fetal size, amniotic fluid index, and to help ascertain the mode of delivery.</p>

                  <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Tests of fetal wellbeing</span></h4>
                  <p>Daily fetal movement counting: 32 weeks gestation and continue until delivery</p>
                  <p>Amniotic fluid index and biophysical profile</p>
                  <p>These tests are usually conducted twice weekly and are instituted at 32 to 34 weeks of gestation in women on insulin and can be done from 34-36 weeks of gestation in women whose diabetes is controlled by diet.</p>
                  <p>Some clinicians manage patients with dietary control without any additional testing.</p>

                  <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Insulin Therapy</span></h4>
                  <p>When diabetes is first detected during pregnancy and cannot be controlled by diet alone, it should be treated with insulin.</p>
                  <p>A post prandial (2 hours) plasma glucose level of more than 140 mg% even on diet control is an indication of insulin therapy.</p>
                  <p>There is frequent change in insulin need during pregnancy and changes in the dosage are made in small increments at a time.</p>
                  <p>Glycemic goals should be around 90 mg/dl before meals and not to exceed 120 mg/dl 2 hours after meals.</p>
                  <p>During the stabilization process of the insulin dose, frequent blood sugar estimation especially at night (2am‚Äì 6am) may be necessary using glucose meter (capillary whole blood, utilized for self-monitoring, is equivalent to venous plasma).</p>
                  <p>As pregnancy advances, ‚Äúa double mixed regime‚Äù may be employed.</p>
                  <p>The patient should receive three to four daily injections of a regular (human Actrapid) and an intermediate acting insulin (Isophane), the latter is to be given before dinner.</p>
                  <p>The aim is to maintain the blood sugar level as near to normal as possible without causing troublesome hypoglycemia.</p>
                  <p>The total first dose of insulin is calculated according to the patient‚Äôs weight as follow:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>In the first trimester ‚Äì weight x 0.7</li>
                    <li>In the second trimester‚Äì weight x 0.8</li>
                    <li>In the third trimester‚Äì weight x 0.9</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Use of subcutaneous insulin infusion by insulin pump is preferred as it is more physiological.</p>
                  <p>Women are instructed on diet composition, insulin dose, recognition and treatment of hypoglycemia, hyperglycaemia and ketosis, adjusting insulin dose in relation to exercise, food and sick days.</p>
                  <p>Oral antidiabetic drug (metformin) is now safely used either alone or combined with insulin.</p>

                  <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Admission</span></h4>
                  <p>In uncomplicated cases, the patient is admitted at 34-36 weeks</p>
                  <p>Early hospitalization </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Facilitates stabilization of diabetes </li>
                    <li>Minimizes the incidence of pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios and preterm labor </li>
                    <li>To select the appropriate time and method of delivery</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Induction of labor</span></h4>
                  <p>The indications are‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâ</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Diabetic women controlled on insulin (GDM or class B diabetes) are considered for induction of labor after 38 completed weeks. </li>
                    <li>Women with vascular complications (pre-eclampsia, IUGR) often require induction after 37 weeks.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Prior to the day of induction of labor, the usual bed time dose of insulin is administered.</p>
                  <p>No breakfast and no morning dose of insulin is given on the day of induction.</p>
                  <p>Normal saline infusion is begun.</p>
                  <p>Induction is done by low rupture of the membranes.</p>
                  <p>Simultaneous oxytocin drip is started, if not contraindicated.</p>
                  <p>Cervical ripening can be done with prostaglandin followed by oxytocin infusion.</p>
                  <p>An intravenous drip of one liter of 5% dextrose is set up with 10 units of soluble insulin.</p>
                  <p>An infusion rate of 100-125 ml/hr (1-1.25 units/hr), will maintain a good glucose control to approximately 100 mg/dl (ACOG-2005).</p>
                  <p>Insulin may also be infused from a syringe pump (0.25-2 units/hr).</p>
                  <p>Blood glucose levels are estimated hourly with a glucose meter and the soluble insulin dose is adjusted accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Epidural analgesia is ideal for pain relief.</p>
                  <p>If the labor fails to start within 6-8 hours or if the labor progresses unsatisfactorily, caesarean section should be performed.</p>

                  <h4><span class="special-text-4">Caesarean Section</span></h4>
                  <p>The indications are:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Elderly primigravida </li>
                    <li>Multigravida with a bad obstetric history </li>
                    <li>Diabetes with complications or difficult to control </li>
                    <li>Obstetric complications like pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios, malpresentation </li>
                    <li>Fetal macrosomia (> 4 kg)</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>As such, 50% of diabetic mothers are delivered by caesarean section</p>

                  <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Procedure: </span></h4>
                  <p>Caesarean section is scheduled for early morning</p>
                  <p>On the day of operation, breakfast and the insulin dose are omitted</p>
                  <p>A normal saline infusion is started</p>
                  <p>The administration of dextrose drip and the insulin dose are to be maintained as mentioned in induction until the patient is able to take fluids by mouth (ACOG-2005)</p>
                  <p>Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with insulin pump is preferred as it is more physiological</p>
                  <p>The insulin requirement suddenly falls following delivery and after stopping the drip, pre-pregnant dose of insulin is to be administered or adjusted from the blood glucose level</p>
                  <p>Epidural or spinal anesthesia is better than general anesthesia as oral feeding could be soon following the operation</p>
                  <p>To control blood glucose: </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>One liter of 5% dextrose drip is started with 10 units of soluble insulin </li>
                    <li>A general guideline for insulin infusion rate is, 1 unit per hour for blood glucose of 100-140 mg/dl, 2 units per hour for blood glucose of 141-180 mg/dl and 3 units per hour for blood glucose of 181-220 mg/dl. Use of motorized syringe pump for insulin infusion is convenient </li>
                    <li>Hourly estimation of blood glucose levels is done with glucose meter and the insulin dose is adjusted accordingly. The blood glucose level should be maintained between 80 and 100 mg per 100 ml</li>
                  </ol>

                  <h4><span class="special-text-4">Spontaneous onset of labor at term</span></h4>
                  <p>Pregnancy may be continued awaiting spontaneous onset of labor and vaginal delivery in:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Young primigravida or multipara with good obstetric history </li>
                    <li>Diabetes well controlled either by diet or insulin or without any obstetrical complication</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>However, in the absence of gadgets for assessment of fetal well-being, it is risky to continue the pregnancy in such cases up to the EDD.</p>
                  <p>In any case, the pregnancy should not be allowed to overrun the expected date.</p>
                  <p><i>Fetal monitoring: </i></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Constant watch to note the fetal condition is mandatory, preferably with continuous electronic fetal monitoring</li>
                    <li>CTG using a scalp electrode is maintained</li>
                    <li>Fetal scalp blood pH sampling is done whenever indicated </li>
                    <li>The combination of fetal hyperglycemia and anoxia contribute not only to fetal distress but responsible for RDS </li>
                    <li>Labor should not be allowed for more than an arbitrary 12 hours and should be augmented by low rupture of the membranes and oxytocin or delivered by caesarean section</li>
                    <li>Shoulder dystocia may be a problem </li>
                    <li>The cord should be clamped immediately after delivery to avoid hypervolemia</li>

                    <p>A fresh blood glucose level after 24 hours will help to adjust the dose of insulin</p>
                    <p>Breastfeeding is encouraged</p>
                    <p>Women who breastfeed should have additional 500 Kcal daily in diet </p>

                    <p>A neonatologist should be present at the time of delivery</p>
                    <p>The baby should preferably be kept in an intensive neonatal care unit and to remain vigilant for at least 48 hours, to detect and to treat effectively any complication likely to arise</p>
                    <p>Asphyxia is anticipated and be treated effectively </p>

                    <p>All babies should have blood glucose to be checked within 2 hours of birth to avoid problems of hypoglycemia (blood glucose < 35 mg/dl)</p>
                    <p> All babies should receive 1 mg vitamin K intramuscularly</p>
                    <p>Early breastfeeding within ¬Ω ‚Äì 1 hour is advocated and to be repeated at three to four hourly intervals thereafter to minimize hypoglycemia and hyperbilirubinemia</p>

                    <p>In most women with GDM, hyperglycemia rapidly resolves shortly after delivery </p>
                    <p>It is reasonable to measure a single random or fasting blood glucose level before discharge from the hospital</p>
                    <p>Postpartum glucose tolerance testing is important for women who had GDM</p>
                    <p>Women with GDM have a 7-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with those who had a normoglycemic pregnancy </p>
                    <p>At 6 to 12 weeks postpartum, only one-third of women with persistent glucose intolerance have an abnormal fasting blood glucose level </p>
                    <p>Therefore, to detect all women with glucose intolerance, a 75-g, fasting, 2-hour, oral glucose tolerance test is recommended</p>
