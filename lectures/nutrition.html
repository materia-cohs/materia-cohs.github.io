            <p>During pregnancy, maternal weight gain affects fetal growth.</p>
            <p>Small neonate size at birth is attributable to poor growth and shortened gestation, and the most unfavorable outcomes occur in the most immature infants. </p>
            <p>Low rate of pregnancy weight gain is associated with increased risk of preterm birth, whereas low second- or third-trimester weight gain has been shown to be associated with spontaneous preterm delivery risk.</p>
            <p>Women with low prepregnancy BMI are at increased risk for preterm birth and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR)- only if they fail to gain adequate weight.</p>
            <p>Appropriate GWG within target ranges can help improve maternal and fetal health. </p>
            <p>Inadequate GWG has been associated with low birth weight (<2500 g) and gaining more weight than recommended with high birth weight (>4000 g) and postpartum weight retention.</p>

          <p>Breast milk is the preferred source of nutrients for newborn infants</p>

          <h4><span class="special-text-4">Lactation</span></h4>
          <p> It is the process by which milk is synthesized and secreted from the mammary glands of the postpartum female breast in response to an infant sucking at the nipple. </p>
          <p>It is a hallmark feature of female mammals.</p>
          <p>It is under endocrine control. </p>
          <p>The two main hormones involved are prolactin and oxytocin.</p>

          <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Action of Prolactin in Lactation</span></h4>
          <p>Prolactin is necessary for the secretion of milk by the cells of the alveoli.</p>
          <p>The level of prolactin in the blood increases markedly during pregnancy and stimulates the growth and development of the mammary tissue, in preparation for the production of milk.</p>
          <p> However, milk is not secreted then (during pregnancy), because progesterone and estrogen block this action of prolactin. </p>
          <p>After delivery, levels of progesterone and estrogen fall rapidly, prolactin is no longer blocked, and milk secretion begins.</p>
          <p>During suckling, the level of prolactin in the blood increases, and stimulates production of milk by the alveoli. </p>
          <p>The prolactin level is highest about 30 minutes after the beginning of the feed, so its most important effect is to make milk for the next feed</p>
          <p>The more a baby suckles and stimulates the nipple, the more prolactin is produced, and the more milk is produced. This effect is particularly important at the time when lactation is becoming established. </p>
          <p>Although prolactin is still necessary for milk production, after a few weeks there is not a close relationship between the amount of prolactin and the amount of milk produced. However, if the mother stops breastfeeding, milk secretion may stop too ‚Äì then the milk will dry up</p>
          <p>More prolactin is produced at night, so breastfeeding at night is especially helpful for keeping up the milk supply. </p>
          <p>Prolactin seems to make a mother feel relaxed and sleepy, so she usually rests well even if she breastfeeds at night.</p>
          <p>Suckling affects the release of other pituitary hormones, including gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH), follicle stimulating hormone, and luteinising hormone, which results in suppression of ovulation and menstruation. Therefore, frequent breastfeeding can help to delay a new pregnancy. Breastfeeding at night is important to ensure this effect</p>

          <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Oxytocin Action</span></h4>
          <p>Oxytocin makes the myoepithelial cells around the alveoli contract. This makes the milk, which has collected in the alveoli, flow along and fill the ducts. It makes the milk that is already in the breast flow for the current feed. </p>
          <p>The oxytocin reflex is also called the ‚Äúletdown reflex‚Äù or the ‚Äúmilk ejection reflex‚Äù. Oxytocin is produced more quickly than prolactin. Oxytocin starts working when a mother expects a feed as well as when the baby is suckling. The reflex becomes conditioned to the mother's sensations and feelings, such as touching, smelling or seeing her baby, or hearing her baby cry, or thinking lovingly about him or her. </p>
          <p>Severe pain or emotionally upset, oxytocin reflex may become inhibited.</p>
          <p>It is important to understand the oxytocin reflex, because it explains why the mother and baby should be kept together and why they should have skin-to-skin contact.</p>
          <p>Oxytocin makes a mother's uterus contract after delivery and helps to reduce bleeding. The contractions can cause severe uterine pain when a baby suckles during the first few days.</p>

          <p>There are four stages of lactation:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Mammogenesis (growth of the breasts)</li>
            <li>Lactogenesis (the functional change of the breasts so that they can secrete milk)</li>
            <li>Galactopoiesis (maintaining the production of milk)</li>
            <li>Involution (the termination of milk production).</li>
          </ol>

          <h4><span class="special-text-4">Mammogenesis</span></h4>
          <p>Mammogenesis is the process of growth and development of the mammary gland in preparation for milk production. </p>
          <p>This process begins when the mammary gland is exposed to estrogen at puberty and is completed during the third trimester of pregnancy</p>
          <p>Before pregnancy, the breast is predominantly adipose tissue without extensive glandular or ductal development.</p>
          <p>Under the influence of uninterrupted and rising concentrations of estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin during pregnancy, the breast increases in water, electrolyte, and fat content to about 0.338kg per breast</p>
          <p>There is also a marked increase in the vascular supply to the breast; the dilated subcutaneous mammary veins become prominent, and the blood flow increases twofold. </p>
          <p>Size and pigmentation of the nipples also increase under the influence of rising estrogen concentrations. </p>
          <p>The sebaceous glands of Montgomery on the periphery of the areolae greatly enlarge; during lactation, they produce a secretion important for nipple conditioning and lubrication.</p>
          <p>Lactogenesis, or the process of changes to the mammary glands to begin producing milk, begins during the late stages of pregnancy. </p>
          <p>It requires 2‚Äì5 days in the human being, this is the length of time necessary for complete secretory maturation of acinar epithelium. </p>
          <p>The inhibition of lactogenesis before delivery appears to be a consequence of high circulating levels of progesterone, which competitively inhibits the binding of cortisol to an intracellular receptor.</p>
          <p> This prevents cortisol from acting synergistically with prolactin to initiate milk production.</p>

          <h4><span class="special-text-4">Lactogenesis</span></h4>
          <p>The rapid fall in progesterone mainly, estrogen, and human placental lactogen levels after deliver allows cortisol binding to occur and lactogenesis to proceed. Administration of large doses of progesterone in the immediate postpartum period inhibits milk production.</p>
          <p>However, once the secretory transformation of the acinar epithelium is completed, sex steroids are ineffective in halting lactogenesis.</p>

          <h4><span class="special-text-4">Galactopoiesis</span></h4>
          <p>Galactopoiesis is the maintenance of milk production once it has been established.</p>
          <p>The single most important factor in successful galactopoiesis is regular and frequent milk removal from the mammary gland.</p>
          <p>Milk removal stimulates further milk secretion by at least three mechanisms. </p>
          <p>First: Regular suckling promotes the regular synthesis and release of both prolactin and oxytocin, which are necessary for continued milk secretion.</p>
          <p>Secondly: Regular emptying of the breasts of milk. The breast has the capacity to store milk for a maximum of 48 hours before there is a substantial decrease in production </p>
          <p>Increased intramammary pressure resulting from distention of the mammary ducts and alveoli with stored milk which occurs in absence of regular emptying leads to reduced milk production, this is caused by the diminished stimulation of the glandular epithelium by prolactin and vascular stasis.</p>
          <p>Blood flow to the mammary glands is also significantly reduced by this increased intramammary pressure, which diminishes the nutrient and hormonal supply necessary for milk production.</p>
          <p>Thirdly: The amount of milk produced daily is fairly closely related to the demand (i.e. the amount of milk removed the previous day), as long as the nutritional and hormonal requirements are met. </p>
          <p>Normal levels of prolactin (5‚Äì20 ng/ml), with surges of prolactin and oxytocin at the time of suckling, are also necessary for the maintenance of normal milk production.</p>

          <h4><span class="special-text-4">Colostrum</span></h4>
          <p>Colostrum is secreted during the first 48‚Äì72 hours postpartum. Only a small volume of colostrum is produced‚Äîapproximately 3 ounces in a 24-hour period‚Äîbut it is sufficient for the newborn in the first few days of life. </p>
          <p>Colostrum is rich with immunoglobulins, which confer gastrointestinal, and also likely systemic, immunity as the newborn adjusts to a nonsterile environment.</p>

          <h4><span class="special-text-4">Transitional and Mature Milk</span></h4>
          <p>After about the third postpartum day, the mother secretes transitional milk that represents an intermediate between mature milk and colostrum. This is followed by mature milk from approximately postpartum day 10.</p>
          <p>Mature milk changes from the beginning to the end of a feeding. The early milk, called foremilk, is watery, translucent, and rich in lactose and protein. Its purpose is to quench the infant‚Äôs thirst. Hindmilk is delivered toward the end of a feeding. It is opaque, creamy, and rich in fat, and serves to satisfy the infant‚Äôs appetite. </p>
