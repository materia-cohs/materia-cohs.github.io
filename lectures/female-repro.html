                   <p>They are paired almond-shaped organs that have both reproductive and endocrine functions— maturation and release of oocytes; steroidogenesis or production of steroid hormones.</p>
                   <p>The ovaries are solid, ovoid structures, about 2 cm in length and 1 cm in width.</p>
                   <p>A fold of peritoneum, mesovarium, attaches them to the broad ligament.</p>
                   <p>The ovaries histologically has an epithelium, a cortex, and a medulla.</p>
                   <p>The ovary receives its blood supply from the ovarian artery, a direct branch of the abdominal aorta, so it bleed in case of trauma. They drain into the ovarian veins.</p>
                   <p>Like the testes, they develop from embryonic tissue along the posterior abdominal wall, near the kidneys.</p>
                   <p>Accessory organs include the uterine tubes, uterus, and vagina.</p>

                   <p>These are also called fallopian tubes. A fold of the broad ligament called the mesosalpinx suspends them.</p>
                   <p>It is about 10—15 cm long and divided into four portions— the intramural/interstitial part, the isthmus, the ampulla and the infundibulum.</p>
                   <p>It is line by columnar epithelium with predominantly two cell types, ciliated cells and non-ciliated (secretory cells). However, the proportion of ciliated cells is very high in the ampulla and in the infundibulum where they play an important role in the transport of ovum along the fallopian tubes.</p>
                   <p>The fallopian tube receive the ovulated oocyte and provide a site for fertilization.</p>
                   <p>It empty into the superolateral region of the uterus via the isthmus.</p>
                   <p>Expand distally around the ovary forming the ampulla.</p>
                   <p>The ampulla ends in the funnel-shaped, ciliated infundibulum containing fingerlike projections called fimbriae.</p>

                   <p>The uterus usually lies in a position of anteversion such that the uterine fundus is anterior to the uterine cervix.</p>
                   <p>The cardinal ligaments, also known as transverse cervical ligaments or Mackenrodt ligaments, are paired structures that act to support the pelvic organs of the female pelvis, it also keeps the uterus anteverted. Along with the uterosacral and pubocervical ligaments, they provide support to prevent pelvic organ prolapse.</p>
                   <p>The body of the uterus is held to the pelvic wall by the broad ligaments and round ligaments.</p>
                   <p>The cavity of the uterus is lined by the endometrium that consists on the surface of mucus secreting columnar epithelium.</p>

                   <p>It is about 2.5 cm in length.</p>
                   <p>Cervical canal – cavity of the cervix that communicates with:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li>The vagina via the external os</li>
                    <li>The uterine body via the internal os</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>The mucus membrane of the cervix has deep glandular follicles that secretes clear, viscid alkaline mucus, which forms the major component of the ‘normal’ or physiological vaginal discharge.</p>
                   <p>Cervical glands also secrete mucus that covers the external os and blocks sperm entry except during midcycle.</p>
                   <p>The epithelium in the secretory upper 2/3rd of the cervix is lined by ciliated columnar epithelium, by non-ciliated columnar in the lower third. Close to the external os, the epithelium changes to stratified epithelium. The junction of the columnar and squamous epithelia at the external os is called the transformation zone. It is an area of rapid cell division and majority of cervical cancer arise from this zone.</p>

                   <p>The upper blind end of the vagina is called the vault.</p>
                   <p>The recess between the cervix and the vagina in the vault is called fornix (upper end of the vagina surrounding the cervix). There are two lateral fornices and an anterior and posterior fornix.</p>
                   <p>The posterior wall of the vagina is about 10 cm long and the anterior wall is about 7.5 cm long.</p>
                   <p>Wall consists of three coats: fibroelastic adventitia, smooth muscle muscularis, and a stratified squamous mucosa.</p>
                   <p>The mucous membrane is thrown into transverse folds and covered by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.</p>
                   <p>Mucosa near the vaginal orifice forms an incomplete partition called the hymen.</p>
                   <p>Once the hymen has been penetrated, the remnants are represented by the carunculae myriformes.</p>
                   <p>At puberty, the epithelium of the vagina is rich in glycogen and the fermentative action of bacteria (Doderlein’s bacillus) on this makes the fluid in the vagina acidic.</p>
                   <p>The mucous membrane of the vagina has no glands, hence the lubrication of the vagina is derived fro the mucus produced by the cervix and the secretions from the Bartholin’s glands.</p>
                   <p>The vaginal artery, which is a branch of the iliac artery, supplies the vagina. Branches from the uterine, internal pudendal and middle rectal arteries also supply the vagina.</p>
                   <p>The rich plexus of veins on the side of the vagina drains through the vaginal veins into the internal iliac veins.</p>
                   <p>The sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers that supply the uterus, cervix, and vagina come from the utero-vaginal nerve plexuses.</p>

                   <p>During fetal development, oogonia (stem cells) divide by mitosis to make primary oocytes.</p>
                   <p>By fifth month there are about 7 million primary oocytes, but most will degenerate during the next 2 months.</p>
                   <p>Primary oocytes begin meiosis and stop in prophase I until puberty.</p>
                   <p>Primordial follicles: Support cells that surround the oocyte in the ovary.</p>
                   <p>1—2 million present at birth.</p>
                   <p>400,000 remain at puberty.</p>

                   <p><span class="special-text">After birth</span></p>
                    <p>Each month, hormones cause several follicles to develop, which triggers the primary oocyte to resume meiosis I.</p>
                    <p>Polar bodies:  When the cell divides, all the cytoplasm and organelles stay with one of the new cells, the other cell is just DNA, and is called a polar body and is discarded.</p>
                    <p>Secondary oocyte: The stage at which ovulation occurs.</p>
                    <p>The secondary oocyte begins meiosis II, but stops in metaphase II.</p>
                    <p>The secondary oocyte is ovulated.</p>
                    <p>Meiosis II is completed only if it is fertilized.</p>

                    <p>Each follicle consists of an immature egg called an oocyte</p>
                    <p>Cells around the oocyte are called:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Follicle cells (one cell layer thick). They are stimulated to mature by FSH from the pituitary gland.</li>
                        <li>Granulosa cells (when more than one layer is present).</li>
                        <li>Thecal cells: Cells in the ovarian stroma</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Thecal & granulosa cells work together to produce estrogen.</p>

                    <p><span class="special-text">Ovarian cycle</span></p>
                    <p>Monthly changes that occur in the ovary during a woman’s reproductive life.</p>
                    <p>Each month FSH stimulates primordial follicles to grow and mature (follicular phase).</p>
                    <p>Ovulation- release of the egg (LH).</p>
                    <p>In the luteal phase the corpus luteum produces progesterone that maintains uterine walls. </p>
                    <p>If fertilization does not occur, the corpus luteum degenerates, within 2 weeks into a mass of scar tissue called the corpus albicans.</p>
