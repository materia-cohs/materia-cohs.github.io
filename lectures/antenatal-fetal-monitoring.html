            <p>Initial aim of antenatal care is to prevent death of the mother </p>
            <p>Antenatal fetal monitoring involves measures aimed at evaluating both fetal growth and well-being during pregnancy</p>
            <p>More attention became focused on perinatal mortality when some reduction in maternal mortality was achieved </p>
            <p>70-90% of fetal deaths occur before the onset of labor </p>
            <p>Perinatal death is about 100 times more common than maternal death</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text"></span></h4>Definitions  
            <p>Live birth: complete expulsion or extraction of a product of conception from its mother, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, that, after separation, breathes or shows any evidence of life (e.g. heartbeat, pulsation of the umbilical cord or definitive movement of voluntary muscles) whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is still attached.</p>
            <p>Intrauterine fetal death (IUFD): death of a fetus during pregnancy (after age of viability but before delivery i.e. >/=28 weeks in this environment) i.e. death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of human conception (after the age of viability), irrespective of the duration of pregnancy. The death is indicated by the fact that after such expulsion/extraction, the fetus does not breathe or show any evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definitive movement of voluntary muscles.</p>
            <p>Stillbirth: any fetus born (following the period of viability) with no signs of life; death may have occurred antepartum or intrapartum.</p>
            <p>Neonatal death (NND): death of a baby within the first 28 days of life </p>
            <p>Early NND: deaths occurring in the first week of life </p>
            <p>Late NND: deaths occurring after 1st week of life but on or before 28th day of life (8-28 days) </p>
            <p>Perinatal deaths: fetal deaths after 28 weeks gestation + infant deaths within 7 days of birth </p>
            <p>Infant death: death of all infants less than 1 year </p>
            <p>Infant mortality rate: no of infant deaths per 1000 live births </p>
            <p>Perinatal mortality rate (PMR): number of perinatal deaths per thousand live births and stillbirths </p>

            <p>Child deaths resulting from complications of labor and delivery outnumber deaths from malaria and HIV combined</p>
            <p>Nigeria is one of 10 countries that contribute to two-thirds of all stillbirths, perinatal, newborn and maternal deaths worldwide. </p>
            <p>Highest number in Africa and second highest globally </p>
            <p>For every maternal death at least seven newborns die and a further four babies are stillborn </p>
            <p>Magnitude of the problem </p>
            <p>Globally every year, </p>
            <ul>
                <li>500,000 maternal deaths </li>
                <li>800,000 neonatal deaths  </li>
                <li>3 million stillbirths; of which about 1 million occur intra-partum </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In 2019, an estimated 1.9 million babies were stillborn at 28 weeks of pregnancy or later, with a global stillbirth rate of 13.9 stillbirths per 1,000 total births. </p>
            <p>Huge differences in stillbirth rates across the globe, with a risk that is up to 23 times higher in the worst affected countries.  </p>
            <p>Greatest number of still births India, Pakistan, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, China and Ethiopia. These six countries account for half of the estimated global number of stillbirths and 44 per cent of global live births. </p>
            <p>Stillbirths contributes to 40% - 60% of perinatal mortality </p>
            <p>Up to 1 million babies that survive birth asphyxia suffer severe disability including cerebral palsy, learning difficulties or other disabilities (WHO) </p>
            <p>50% of all infant deaths occur in the first week of life (Early NND) </p>
            <p>50% of early NND occur in the 1st day of life</p>
            <p>For a lot of babies, birth day = death day</p>
            <p>99% of intra-partum stillbirths and deaths resulting from birth asphyxia occur in low and middle income countries (highest figures in Sub-Saharan Africa and South-east Asia);  </p>
            <p>Remaining 1 % occurs in developed countries [where both stillbirths and neonatal deaths are rare events (4 per 1000)]. </p>

            <h4><i>In Nigeria, where do we stand?</i></h4>
            <p>Highest stillbirth rate in Africa (42 per thousand)  </p>
            <p>Third highest stillbirth rate in the world (India> Pakistan > Nigeria) </p>
            <p>3rd highest neonatal death rate in the world (neonatal mortality rate 47 per thousand live births ;) (Afghanistan; 60/1000; Pakistan 53/1000) </p>
            <p>Global stillbirth rate: 18.4/1000 </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Chronic asphyxia (from IUGR or prolonged pregnancy); accounts for about 30% of cases </li>
                <li>Obstetric or pregnancy related conditions (e.g.  abruptio placenta, rhesus iso-immunization,  hypertensive disorders of pregnancy); account for  another 30% of cases. </li>
                <li>Congenital malformations and chromosomal abnormalities; account for 15% of fetal deaths </li>
                <li>Infections e.g. TORCHES; accounts for about 5%. </li>
                <li>Deaths of unexplained causes; no obvious maternal, fetal or obstetric cause of death identified; accounts for 20% of cases. </li>
                <li>Majority of fetal deaths occur before 32 weeks gestation </li>
                <li>Fetuses from 40-41 weeks have a threefold higher risk of death; those >42 weeks are at a 12 fold increased risk </li>

                    <p>In 3rd trimester, the fetus spends 10% of its time making gross fetal body movements </p>
                    <p>Mother can appreciate 70-80% of these movements</p>

                    <h4><span class="special-text">Factors affecting maternal perception of fetal movement </span></h4>
                    <p>Fetal movements are poorly perceived when women are involved in normal daily activities and are better detected when resting and focused on fetal activity.</p>
                    <p>The presence of an anterior placenta is also known to reduce maternal perception of movements, but this ceases to be relevant in the third trimester. </p>
                    <p>Obesity, smoking, use of sedative drugs, and primiparity are associated with reduced perception</p>

                   <p>These movements also appear on the tracing together with the fetal heart rate and uterine activity. </p>
                   <p>Interpreted based on the premise that in a normal (non-hypoxic fetus), there is acceleration of the fetal heart rate in response to fetal movement. This implies that the autonomic nervous system of the fetus is functioning properly and is capable of reacting appropriately to stressors.  </p>

                   <p>A fetus has a normal baseline if its value lies between 110 and 160 bpm. </p>
                   <p>Preterm fetuses tend to have values towards the upper end of this range and post-term fetuses towards the lower end. </p>

                   <p>It is a good indicator of how healthy the fetus is at the moment the test is being performed.  </p>
                   <p>A healthy fetus will constantly adapt its heart rate to respond to changes in its environment.  </p>
                   <p>Normal variability is between 10-25 bpm.  </p>
                   <p>Variability is determined by looking at the difference between the peaks and the troughs of the baseline FHR of the CTG tracing.  </p>

                   <p>A healthy fetus has accelerations in the FHR in response to contractions and fetal movement.  </p>
                   <p>Note: If an acceleration lasts 10 minutes or more, it is regarded as a change in baseline heart rate.</p>

                    <li>Variable decelerations (V-shaped) exhibit a rapid drop (onset to nadir in less than 30 seconds), good variability within the deceleration, rapid recovery to the baseline, varying in size, shape and relationship to uterine  contractions caused by umbilical cord compression, and  on their own are seldom associated with an important  degree of fetal hypoxia. </li>
                    <li>Late decelerations (U-shaped or with reduced variability) have a gradual onset, gradual return to the baseline (>30 seconds), or reduced variability within the deceleration. </li>

                    <li>No decelerations </li>
                   </ul>
                   <p>It is reassuring to the physician as chance of intrauterine fetal death within 1 week of a normal CTG is 1 per 1000</p>

                    <li>Relies solely on fetal heart rate to determine fetal wellbeing </li>
                    <li>Reactive NST implies that the fetus is not asphyxiated at the time of testing  </li>
                    <li>Associated with high false positive rates (50- 75%) </li>
                    <li>High proportion of fetuses will be judged to have a non-reassuring status and may be subjected to unnecessary intervention</li>

                  <p>Low false negative rate i.e. normal score with subsequent death of the fetus within 1 week (0.7 per 1000) </p>
                  <p>By the time the fetus develops an abnormal score prompting delivery, it is already severely hypoxic</p>

                  <p>10: normal infant; low risk of chronic asphyxia;  repeat testing at weekly intervals; repeat twice  weekly in diabetic patient and patient at 41 weeks </p>
                  <p>8: normal infant; low risk of chronic asphyxia; repeat testing at weekly intervals; oligohydramnios is an indication for delivery </p>
                  <p>6: suspect chronic asphyxia; if >/=36 weeks or oligohydramnios present, deliver </p>
                  <p>4: suspect chronic asphyxia; if 36 weeks, deliver. If < 32 weeks, repeat </p>
                  <p>0-2: extend time of testing to 120 minutes, if persistent score </=4, deliver regardless of GA</p>

                <p>Can identify placenta and fetal blood vessels; assess placental function </p>
                <p>Used to assess fetal hemodynamic status by detecting movement of blood in fetal, maternal and placental circulations </p>
                <p>Useful in IUGR </p>
                <p>In the presence of placental dysfunction and growth restriction, the earliest changes are detected in uterine arteries followed by the umbilical artery and then the middle cerebral artery and lastly the ductus venosus, usually indicates imminent fetal demise.</p>
                <p>Noninvasive assessment of fetal, maternal and placental circulation </p>
                <p>Umbilical artery velocimetry; determines the degree of blood flow in the umbilical arteries; these depend on uteroplacental circulation </p>
                <p>Blood flow slows down in diastole and gets faster in systole </p>
                <p>Degree of slowing down is dependent on the resistance in the artery </p>
                <p>Reversed end-diastolic flow is associated with increased perinatal mortality</p>
                <p>Relies on Doppler Effect which observes changes in the frequency of transmitted waves when relative motion exists between the source and the target</p>
                <p>These sound waves are utilised to assess fetal haemodynamic status by detecting movement of blood in the fetal, maternal or placental circulations.</p>
                <p>Measurements of blood flow in these vessels, helps to determine the health or otherwise of the fetus, and the timing of delivery.</p>
                <p>Vessels that have been studied extensively in relation to this are the uterine artery, umbilical vessels, ductus venosus and middle cerebral artery.</p>
                <p>Normally, diastolic flow in umbilical arteries increases (i.e. resistance falls) throughout gestation resulting in improved blood supply to the fetus</p>
                <p>Increased umbilical artery resistance implies faulty placental perfusionâ€” fetal hypoxia, IUGR, IUFD</p>
