            <p>Labor is the physiological process by which regular painful uterine contractions result in progressive effacement, dilatation of the cervix, and descent of the presenting part which ultimately leads to the delivery of the fetus and placenta through the birth canal.</p>
            <p>The passage of the fetus through the birth canal during labor can be unpredictable and hazardous.</p>
            <p>To majority of families, labor brings joy to the families </p>
            <p>Poor understanding and management of labor may lead to perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality. </p>
            <p>There is interplay between the 3Ps: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Power = uterine contractions </li>
                <li>Passenger = fetus </li>
                <li>Passage = birth canal (bony pelvis, soft tissue of the pelvis and the perineum)</li>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Prostaglandin and oxytocin release</span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Maternal corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) increases in concentration and potentiate the action of oxytocin and prostaglandins on myometrial contractility. Fetal cortisol- converts progesterone to estrogen.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Myometrial factor </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Prostaglandin and oxytocin increase myometrial intracellular free calcium ions which results in increase in formation of contractile actin-phosphorylated myosin</li>

           <p>Symptoms & Signs of onset of labor: </p>
           <p>Regular abdominal pain, backache, show, liquor drainage. </p>
           <p>In latent phase- Palpable uterine contractions minimum of 1 in 10min, cervical dilatation and effacement. </p>

           <h4><span class="special-text-4">1st stage- </span></h4>
            <p>This is the stage which represent dilatation of the cervical os from 0 cm to full cervical dilatation of 10 cm in a parturient at term.</p>
            <p>It is composed of two phases</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4b">Latent phase: </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Woman at term with labor pains</li>
                <li>Uterine contraction frequency of at least once every 10 minutes interval </li>
                <li>Sterile vaginal exam reveals a cervical dilatation <4cm </li>
                <li>Normal latent phase lasts a maximum duration of 8 hours, usually shorter in multiparous women.</li>
                <li>Latent phase is prolonged if it extends beyond hours up to a maximum of 24 hours without the woman developing features of active phase.</li>
                <li>If after 24 hours, the woman has still not developed the features of active phase of labor but still maintains the features of latent phase, then the correct diagnosis is false labor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">Active phase: </span></h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Cervical dilatation =/> 4cm to 10 cm</li>
                <li>At this stage, the cervical os characteristically dilates at 1 cm per hour</li>
                <li>Conventionally, a period of 12 hours is the maximum duration, shorter in multiparous women.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">2nd stage </span></h4>
            <p>This is the stage of labor from full cervical os dilatation of 10 cm till the baby is delivered.</p>
            <p>Can also be divided into two phases</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The propulsive/passive phase- starts from full dilatation up to the descent of the presenting part to the pelvic floor. Often manifested by an irresistible urge to push by the mother.</li>
                <li>The expulsive/active phase- this phase is enhanced by voluntary pushing effort of the woman and may be shortened by an episiotomy. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both phases last a duration of one hour each. Hence, a normal active second stage should not last more than 2 hour in a nulliparous woman and 1 hour in women who delivered vaginally before.</p>
            <p>Use of epidural anesthesia will influence the length and management of the second stage of labor. A passive second stage of 1 or 2 hours is usually recommended to allow the head to rotate and descend prior to active pushing.</p>

            <h4><span class="special-text-4">3rd stage</span></h4>
            <p>This is the time from delivery of the fetus or fetuses until complete delivery of the placenta (e) and membranes. </p>
            <p>Occurs 1â€”10 minutes after the birth of the baby</p>
            <p>A third stage lasting more than 30 minutes is defined as abnormal and the placenta is said to be retained.</p>
            <p>The drastic decrease in the volume of the uterine cavity after the expulsion of the fetus has the effect of shearing off the placenta from the decidual attachment.</p>
            <p>This separation is reinforced by contractions and retractions of the uterine muscles by the mother during bearing down.</p>
            <p>Signs of placenta separation are</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Apparent lengthening of the umbilical cord</li>
                <li>A small gush of blood from the placental bed</li>
                <li>Rise of uterine fundus to above the umbilicus</li>
                <li>Uterus assuming a more globular shape and become hardened</li>
            </ul>
            <p>An abnormal third stage will be marked by</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Poor uterine contractions</li>
                <li>Poor or no placental separation and expulsion</li>
                <li>Significant blood loss exceeding 500 ml.</li>

           <p>Primary dysfunctional labor- defined as a labor in which the active phase progresses at a rate of less than 1cm / hr before a normal active phase slope has been established. </p>
           <p>It is usually due to inefficient uterine contraction </p>
           <p>Treatment â€“ majority will respond to oxytocin secondary arrest- occurs when cervical dilatation ceases after a normal portion of active phase dilatation. </p>
           <p>Causes: inefficient uterine contraction, malpresentation/malposition, CPD</p>
           <p>Treatment- depends on the etiology </p>
           <p>Oxytocin, C/S, etc.</p>

                    <p>The pregnant woman will often present with the claim they are in labor.</p>
                    <p>The woman is admitted and history is taken.</p>
                    <p>A detailed clinical assessment is done, including a vaginal examination.</p>
                    <p>The Bishop Score is assessed at the vaginal examination and recorded. </p>
                    <p>The woman is closely observed till features of active phase labor occur.</p>
                    <p>Monitor and record fetomaternal vital signs.</p>
                    <p>This stage does not require any intervention in the absence of any other concomitant obstetric problem. Common possible problems that may require intervention includes</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pre-eclampsia/eclampsia</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p>Interventions will also be justified if complications develop. Complications such as</p>

                    </ul>
                    <li>Repeat vaginal examination and begin active phase management if features of active phase such as cervical os dilatation of 4 cm or greater is found at vaginal examination.</li>
                    <li>If there are still no active phase features after vaginal examination done at 8 hour from the first examination, the diagnosis is now prolonged latent phase.</li>
                    <li>If after 24 hours from the first vaginal examination, a repat vaginal examination still confirms persistent latent phase features, the diagnosis is now revised as false labor.</li>

The intensity of contractions in the active phase at its peak can reduce placental blood flow and cause hypoxia.

                    <p>Often the beginning of the second stage is suspected when the woman expresses the irresistible urge to push. </p>
                    <p>A vaginal examination can be done to confirm full cervical dilatation.</p>
                    <p>The woman will get an expulsive reflex with each contraction, and will generally take a deep breath, hold it, and strain down (the Valsalva manoeuvre).</p>
                    <p>Use of regional analgesia (epidural or spinal) may interfere with the normal urge to push, and the second stage is more often diagnosed on a routine scheduled vaginal examination.</p>
                    <p>Women should be discouraged from lying supine, or semi-supine, and should adopt any other position that they find comfortable. Lying in the left lateral position, squatting and â€˜all foursâ€™ are particularly effective options.</p>
                    <p>If at full cervical os dilatation, there is poor head descent, no urge to push and CPD has been excluded, oxytocin can be used to augment labor.</p>
                    <p>Maternal and fetal surveillance intensifies in the second stage, as described previously. The development of fetal acidemia may accelerate, and maternal exhaustion and ketosis increase in line with the duration of active pushing. Fetal assessment options include</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inspection of amniotic fluid- fresh meconium staining, absence of fluid, and heavy blood-stained fluid or bleeding are markers of potential fetal compromise.</li>
                        <li>Intermittent auscultation of the fetal heart using a Pinard stethoscope or a hand-held Doppler ultrasound.</li>
                        <li>Continuous external electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) using CTG.</li>
                        <li>Continuous internal electronic fetal monitoring using a fetal scalp electrode (FSE) and CTG.</li>
                        <li>Fetal scalp blood sampling (FBS).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>An episiotomy can be performed to hasten delivery if there is suspected fetal compromise (e.g. fetal bradycardia). It will only accelerate the birth if the head has passed through the pelvic floor, so should not be performed too early. It is performed during most instrumental births (ventouse or forceps). Effective analgesia is required, and this will usually be with infiltration of local anesthetic if the woman does not have an epidural.</p>

                    <p>The third stage is the interval between delivery of the baby and the complete expulsion of the placenta and membranes.</p>
                    <p>Management of the third stage can be described as â€˜activeâ€™ or â€˜physiological/passiveâ€™.</p>
                    <h4><span class="special-text-4">Active management</span></h4>
                    <p>Consists primarily of </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Intramuscular injection of 10 IU oxytocin, given as the anterior shoulder of the baby is delivered, or immediately after delivery of the baby.</li>
                        <li>Early clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord.</li>
                        <li>Controlled cord traction </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Evidence shows that it reduces the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH).</p>
                    <p>Controlled cord traction</p>
                    <p>When the signs of placental separation are recognized, controlled cord traction is used to expedite delivery of the placenta.</p>
                    <p>When a contraction is felt, the left hand should be moved suprapubically and the fundus elevated with the palm facing towards the mother (countertraction). At the same time, the right hand should grasp the cord and exert steady traction so that the placenta separates and is delivered gently, care being taken to peel off all the membranes, usually with a twisting motion. </p>
                    <p>Uterine inversion is a rare complication, which may occur if the uterus is not adequately controlled with the left hand and excessive traction is exerted on the cord in the absence of complete separation and a uterine contraction.</p>

                    <h4><span class="special-text-4">Physiological management</span></h4>
                    <p>Physiological management of the third stage is where the placenta is delivered by maternal effort and no uterotonic drugs are given to assist this process. Separation is awaited and placenta and membranes allowed to deliver spontaneously with the aid of gravity or with nipple stimulation.</p>
                    <p>This method is easily complicated by primary post-partum hemorrhage (PPH).</p>
